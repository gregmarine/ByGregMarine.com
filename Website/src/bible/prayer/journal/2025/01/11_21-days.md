# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting - 2025 Day 7

Asking God to help us strengthening others is today's prayer focus. It is the second part of Luke 22:31-32. Having unfailing faith in the One whose faithfulness is far greater than my own can bring me strength. And when my faith brings me back from my personal failures, namely sin, perhaps my testimony will strengthen others. Not that I should fail just so I can come back...LOL I simply know I'll fail. But my faith tells me we have a God who is merciful and gracious. He is kind and gentle. He is faithful and provides the joy. His loving kindness endures forever. If that doesn't strengthen me, I don't know what else can!

*Father in Heaven, thank You for Your faithfulness. It renews my strength every day. The rest I find in You restores my soul. Lord, please strengthen my faith. Not just for my sake. But also for the sake of those impacted by my presence in this world. Help me shine Your light in this world. Help me to strengthen my sisters and brothers in Christ.*

*As I continue to wait on and hope in You for my future church home, I lift up that church to You today. I pray that You also strengthen their faith in Your faithfulness. Empower the congregation to strengthen each other as they complete the mission You have called them to in the community. May their unity in faith be a beacon to encourage the community. And as that faithful beacon shines and draws more people to You, may the process further strengthen those who come.*

*Finally, I pray for the pastor. Renew his faith today as he prepares for tomorrow's teaching. Strengthen his faith with Your spirit and truth. May the words You speak through his sermon strengthen all of the people who hear. Open their ears to hear and their hearts to listen. May the faith of the pastor be an inspiration to the congregation always. And please strengthen the faith of the pastor's family. Bless them to be a blessing to others.*

*Thank You for Your faithfulness, oh Lord! With gratitude, and in Your Name, I pray. AMEN!*
