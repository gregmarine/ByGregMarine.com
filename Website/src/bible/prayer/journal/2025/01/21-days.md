# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting - 2025

For the third year in a row, I have started my year with a season of prayer and fasting. Fasting is about me denying something I want in pursuit of something God wants. I keep the specific prayers between God and myself. But I put my prayer focus in this journal.

This was actually the first year I journaled the focuses for each day. I wanted to be able to come back here to refocus from time to time. But I do know that the first 2 years I've done this season have changed my life too. This is a great way to kick off a new year.

I also do prayer and fasting seasons in other parts of the year. Those depend on such things as major life decisions. Remaining focused on God's Will and how that impacts my life has been life changing, to say the least. This year's 21 day season to start the year has been no different. I'm excited about the growth I've experienced and for how this year will go.

Here is a full list of this year's 21 days of prayer and fasting journal entries. You'll notice there are 24 entries instead of 21. That's because there were some break and reflection/recap days in this plan.
