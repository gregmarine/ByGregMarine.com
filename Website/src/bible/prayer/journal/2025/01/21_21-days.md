# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting - 2025 Day 17

Today's prayer focus comes from the same passage as yesterday, John 17:6-12. But instead of asking God to *give me the words* to speak, I'm asking Him to *let them hear*. Meaning, I'm asking that God opens the hearts, souls, and minds of those He sends me to that they may received the words He provides me. I'm starting to see the significance of the order of these prayers the author is showing me.

*Father, thank You for the words to share with others of the Hope I have in You. Today, I ask that they are well received by those You have sent me to. Please open their ears to hear and their hearts to listen. I've had a closed heart and mind in the past. So I know what that is like. I ask that You open theirs as You have opened mine!*

*LORD, empower the church through Your Holy Spirit. Open the hearts, souls, and minds of the people...Your people. As You send us out into the world, open the ears and hearts of those You send us to so that they may hear and listen to the message of Your salvation. This world is hurting. May Your words heal them!*

*God, please be with the pastors. As they speak Your Word into the ears and hearts of their congregations, I pray the people will received Your Word and be Blessed.*

*In Your Name I pray, AMEN!*
