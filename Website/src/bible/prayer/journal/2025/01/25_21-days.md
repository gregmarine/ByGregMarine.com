# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting - 2025 Day 21

On this final day of the season of prayer and fasting for 2025, I take a look back on this past week. Jesus' longest prayer comes from John 17. It has been a good week of prayer focus. But it also came with some struggles. These aren't easy prayers to pray. I'm asking God to help me and guide me through the greatest mission of my life. Sharing my faith and leading others to Him isn't the easiest thing for anyone to do. I even started off the week not really being ready for all of this. A week later, I'm still not ready. But that's just from my own human understanding. So, I'll continue to pray this prayers this year. God will prepare me for all that He wants me to do.

A recap:

2. [Give me the words](/blog/2025/01/20_on-the-move#_21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting)
3. [Let them hear](/bible/prayer/journal/2025/01/21_21-days)
4. [Protection over those who hear and believe](/bible/prayer/journal/2025/01/22_21-days)
5. [All future believers](/bible/prayer/journal/2025/01/23_21-days)
6. [Unite us with the One and in Love](/bible/prayer/journal/2025/01/24_21-days)

I'll spend some time today reflecting on the meaning of these 6 prayers. They are probably the most important of all the prayers I'll ever pray. They are about the path that lead us all to God.
