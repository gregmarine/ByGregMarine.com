# 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting - 2025 Day 22

Today is the third break in the devotional book. It can be considered a day of reflection. Something the author suggests is, that unlike the other prayers in the book, this past week isn't something you simply do in the order it is presented. It really is a set of prayers that are to be prayed together.

The reason for this is what the prayers represent. It is the pathway to God. We can't really pray that He would place us where He wants us to share the Gospel without already having the words, or that those words would be heard. We also don't want to be there with the right words that would be heard without already praying for protection over the new believer. And so on...

It is an important and powerful set of prayers. I'd like to weave them into the tapestry of my daily prayers. But it is a a huge responsibility. Am I ready for that? Probably not...LOL But I feel that is okay at this point. God has been preparing me my entire life. Everything has been building up to where He is leading me. I just need to follow.

As I go through these prayers over and again, this day would be a good day to stop and meditate on Jesus' longest prayer. It may seem like a repeat from yesterday. And in a way, it is. This prayer is just *that* important!
