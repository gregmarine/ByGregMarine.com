# Berean Standard Bible

My preferred translation for study, general reading, and for references on this site, is the Berean Standard Bible. It is a public domain translation with all of the resources they used to translate the original language available as well.

The Holy Bible, Berean Standard Bible, BSB is produced in cooperation with [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/), [Discovery Bible](https://discoverybible.com/), [OpenBible.com](https://openbible.com/), and the Berean Bible Translation Committee. This text of God's Word has been [dedicated to the public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Start reading the Bible from the beginning with [Genesis](/bible/translations/bsb/01_gen/), or following along with the [Bible in a Year plan](/bible/plans/bible-in-a-year/).
