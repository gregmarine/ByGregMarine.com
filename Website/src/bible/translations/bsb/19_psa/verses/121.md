1	A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come?
2	My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
3	He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber.
4	Behold, the Protector of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
5	The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand.
6	The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
7	The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul.
8	The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
