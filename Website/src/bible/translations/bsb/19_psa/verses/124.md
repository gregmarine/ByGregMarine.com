1	A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—
2	if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,
3	when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,
4	then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,
5	then the raging waters would have swept us away.
6	Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.
8	Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
