1	A song of ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.
2	Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.
3	What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?
4	Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree!
5	Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!
6	Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.
7	I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
