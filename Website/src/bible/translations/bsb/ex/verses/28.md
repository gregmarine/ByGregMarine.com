Exodus 28:4	These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that they may serve Me as priests.
Exodus 28:5	They shall use gold, along with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
Exodus 28:6	They are to make the ephod of finely spun linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.

Exodus 28:10	six of their names on one stone and the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth.
Exodus 28:11	Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings.
Exodus 28:12	Fasten both stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear their names on his two shoulders as a memorial before the LORD.
Exodus 28:13	Fashion gold filigree settings
Exodus 28:14	and two chains of pure gold, made of braided cord work; and attach these chains to the settings.

Exodus 28:30	And place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece of judgment, so that they will also be over Aaron’s heart whenever he comes before the LORD. Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD.
Exodus 28:31	You are to make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth,
Exodus 28:32	with an opening at its top in the center. Around the opening shall be a woven collar with an opening like that of a garment, so that it will not tear.
Exodus 28:33	Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn all the way around the lower hem, with gold bells between them,
Exodus 28:34	alternating the gold bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe.

Exodus 28:36	You are to make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.
Exodus 28:37	Fasten to it a blue cord to mount it on the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban.
Exodus 28:38	And it will be worn on Aaron’s forehead, so that he may bear the iniquity of the holy things that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all their holy gifts. It shall always be on his forehead, so that they may be acceptable before the LORD.
Exodus 28:39	You are to weave the tunic with fine linen, make the turban of fine linen, and fashion an embroidered sash.
