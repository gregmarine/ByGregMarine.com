I don't often see much other than wildlife in the pond I walk around. But today was a different story...hahaha

As I began one of my walks today, I noticed something floating in the water. From a distance, I wondered if it was duck. As I got closer, I was surprised to see that it was a radio controlled boat...LOL The *pilot* was no where to be seen...hehehe

Shortly after I spotted it and took the photo, someone showed up at the pond with another radio controlled boat. Apparently this little boat had lost signal or power or something. The person went to get another boat to push it ashore...LOL

Not long after that, they had both boats going. It was pretty neat to see someone using the pond. I suspect they aren't supposed to be doing that. But I don't see a problem with it. As long as they are keeping an eye open for alligators, it is safe in my opinion. There were lots of birds around today. When I see birds, I don't see alligators. When I see alligators, I don't see birds...hehehe

Strangely, the birds didn't see to mind the boats...HAHAHA
