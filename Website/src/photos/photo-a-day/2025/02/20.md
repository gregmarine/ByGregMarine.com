A year ago, I decided I would get back into baseball. In years past, I loved the game. As a kid, I played in little leagues. I loved playing. I loved watching. As I transitioned into adulthood in the late 90s, I fell away from keeping up with this wonderful game.

Last year, I decided to take it up as part of my friendship with my deerest friend. Her team is the LA Dodgers. So, I began following and rooting for them. It was fun to talk about the team and the games throughout the year. I didn't follow along much during Spring Training. I was only just beginning to get back into it.

But then the season opener was on my birthday! I've been hooked ever since...LOL And to top it off, they were the World Series Champions for the 2024 season!!! Woohoo!!! What a fantastic year to pick up the sport again and what a fantastic team to join!!!

This season, I'm subscribed to the MLB TV so I can watch as many games as I can. Last year, I was at the mercy of the MLB free games, Apple TV, and when the broadcast networks had the games...hehehe
