Although I did spend some time outside today, I didn't take any videos or still photos of anything outside. So, today's is an inside job...hehehe

I spent the afternoon at my favorite restaurant, Zen Kitchen & Bar. I sometimes like to work from the corner of the bar area. Sometimes it is working on personal projects. But today, it was for my day job...hehehe

They use a water filtration system for the water they serve to drink. Knowing them, they also use the filtered water for cooking...hehehe I like to have my water with no ice and with a slice of lemon and lime.

In today's photo, you can see a glass half full. This was my first fill up of the day. So, there is a single slice of lemon and a single slice of lime. As time goes on, more slices are added to maintain the flavor. By the end, the water is a tad cloudy from all the slices...LOL

A little side note: it sometimes feels weird to be the only one at the *bar* who isn't drinking alcohol...LOL Today, another gentleman was there who wasn't drinking alcohol either. So, I gave him a nod and raised a glass to him...hehehe This time, there were two of us not drinking ;-)
