I didn't get outside today due to weather. So, it was an inside photo shoot today...LOL

This painting, *Day at the Beach*, is one I created 3 years ago. It was inspired by a conk shell I saw at Honeymoon Island Beach in late 2021. It had a crab in it...hehehe So, I didn't get to keep the shell. But I did keep a scallop shell I found. I glued the scallop shell to the canvas and then painted the small conk shell on the canvas and placed its *shadow* to be cast on the physical scallop shell. This is one of a few paintings I did where I included physical subjects with the painted ones.

Here is a photo of the conk shell that inspired the painting <3
