I'm not really sure what species this bird is. It might be an Osprey? I thought it was cool to capture a plane overhead at the same time...hehehe

I almost didn't choose this one. I have chosen several so far this year that are birds. But I finally decided to choose it. Why does it matter if so many of my photos are of birds?!? There are so many wonderful species to see here. It actually makes sense that several of my photos are of birds. I love birds. I shouldn't have second guessed myself. In the end, the fact I was second guessing was the final decision to go for it. The photo was my first choice anyway...LOL
