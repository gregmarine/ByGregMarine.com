Nothing says I live in Florida quite like seeing honeybees doing their thing on the third day of February...LOL I see bees year round, actually. As long as it isn't too cold, they are out and about pollinating and gathering what they need to make their honey...hehehe

When I was a child, I went off the beaten path as a shortcut through a wood at church camp. I was actually following some other children who were doing the same. They stirred up a bees' nest that was in the ground by accident. I'm not sure if they got stung or not. But those of us in my group were definitely attacked. The other boys in my group ran back to the cabins. My instinct was to run as fast as I could to the nurse's station...LOL As I was running, one of the adults tried to stop me because he could see what looked like a hundred bees flying around under my shirt. I was running too fast for him to stop me, though. I was in flight mode and my brain couldn't think of anything else but to run to the nurse. When I arrived, I had so many bee stings that I was quite ill for the rest of camp. To this day I don't know why they didn't rush me to the hospital...HAHAHA In today's world, they would have...but this was back in the 80s when they would duct tape your arm back on if you cut it off with a chainsaw...LOL j/k The camp director was thankful I ran to the nurse. He said that is the only way they would have known there were others who were also attacked. They went and got the others so they could be treated as well.

After that, I was deathly allergic to bee stings for years. I'm not now, though. But for years I was so afraid of bees...hehehe Now, I'll walk right up to one and ask it how its day is going...LOL This one allowed me to take its photograph...LOL
