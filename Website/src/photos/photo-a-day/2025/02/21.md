# 2025, February 21

I spent a large portion of the day at Disney. So all of my photos today day were from there. I had a few that I really loved. But there was only one that landed the position of featured photo...hehehe

There are usually birds, squirrels, and rabbits that hang around Disney. I often joke about how the audioanimatronics looks so real...LOL Of course, these animals are actually real...hehehe

There were some ducks hanging out around the tables I was standing at one time today. This one, even allowed me to bend down and take a closeup...hehehe After a few shots, I realized my shadow was in the photo. So, I took this one last one to make sure my Mickey ears were clearly visible...HAHAHA
