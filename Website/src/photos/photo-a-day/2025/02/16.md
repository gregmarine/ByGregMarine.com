Today has been a bit gloomy here in Florida...LOL And a little ominous looking, if you ask me...LOL A rain storm even drift on through my area.

One the one walk I was able to squeeze in, the birds were looking a little funny. These are seagulls in this photo. They were circling around up there. It was so weird. I hadn't ever seen seagulls doing that around here. It was like they were preparing for death! HAHAHA j/k

I also saw my bald eagle friend battling it out with another bird. I'm not sure what that was about. The other bird looked like an osprey. The eagle was trying to catch a fish in the pond...hehehe

It was very windy when all of this was taking place. I almost didn't take my walk. But I'm grateful I did. I was able to capture this moment and I now have the memories to cherish...hehehe
