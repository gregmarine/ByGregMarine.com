Walking around a pond most days doesn't lend itself to a variety of sights. I most often see pleasant views of the sun, clouds, and birds. Occasionally an alligator will show up. But today, I saw a castle!

This photo is one of the reasons I decided I would take at least one photo each day. I don't have a clue how long this little castle has been sitting next to the pond. But I'm certain I've seen it down there before. And perhaps the low water level revealed its full form for the first time in ages. I had assumed it was the stump of an old tree that might have grown by the pond at one time.

Since I'm trying to see new things through my lens, I decided I'd go down and take closer look at, and a photo of, this *old tree stump* by the pond. But when I got down to it, it wasn't a stump at all! Instead, it was a magical land of ✨ enchantment ✨ HAHAHA

It appears to be one of those castle you'd put in an aquarium to entertain fish...hehehe Based on the condition and the stuff growing on it, I'd say it has been part of this pond for a few years and hasn't been in an aquarium for quite some time...if ever...LOL
