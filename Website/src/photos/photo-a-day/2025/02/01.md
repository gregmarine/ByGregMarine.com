# 2025, February 01

Since most of the day was spent at Disney, today's photo comes from my time there.

In our Florida subtropical climate, the cherry blossoms begin to bloom much earlier than their counterparts in the east...hehehe When I do my LEGO bonsai cherry blossom tree, I try to stick with the seasons in Japan. But here in Florida, they tend to bloom in the winter instead of the spring.

I had a few other honorable mentions from today. So, I decided to include them here in this photo journal. I did not post these on social media, however.

Spaceship Earth with the moon and a planet. The other *stars* are just glares of the Spaceship Earth lights...hehehe
