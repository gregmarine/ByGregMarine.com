The other day, I saw a bright blue winged bird for the first time in my life. I didn't get a good look at it that day. But I saw it again today!

This is most likely an [Eastern bluebird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_bluebird). You can't really tell in this photo. But I did get a closer look with my eyes. The chest of the bird looks exactly like the ones featured on the Wikipedia page...hehehe

The first time I saw one the other day, it's bright blue wings caught my eye. At first I thought I was imagining it...LOL But then I saw it fly down to the ground and then flew off. There was no mistaking it. It was real...HAHAHA I'm glad I saw one again today. Although I wish I had captured the brilliance of the bright blue, I'm still happy with today's photo <3
