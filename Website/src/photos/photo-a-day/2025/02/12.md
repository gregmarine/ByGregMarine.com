I've owned two properties in my lifetime. And both times, I preferred to leave *pests* to their *pesty* ways because they are created beings like myself. I find things like ants very fascinating.

There are a lot of ants in the community here...hehehe I've taken photos and videos of anthills a few times in the last few years. This particular one caught my attention tonight. They had burrowed in the ground next to this sidewalk and managed to pile up the hills *on* the sidewalk. It gives the appears of the letter "T"...hehehe

I posted this to socials. But I also posted a video of the ants as a Story on Instagram and Facebook. The song I paired with the video is *Taking Care of Business*...LOL
