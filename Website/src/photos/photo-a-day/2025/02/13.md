I used to admire these things called *air plants* at the shops in Florida when I would vacation here. Shortly after I moved here, I found out they appear naturally all over trees randomly around the state...for free...LOL

It was a bit windy when I was taking the source video for this photo. That feature hung on really well...LOL But, it also made it difficult to find a frame to grab the photo from...hehehe

These plants are amazing. They basically live on other plants, such as the tree this one is on. They draw in moisture from the air...hence the name *air plants*. Some of them even have blossoms. I'm not sure this one has one, though...hehehe
