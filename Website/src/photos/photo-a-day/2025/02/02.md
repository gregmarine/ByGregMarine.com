The location I go to for my church is in a movie theatre. I love the front of movie theatres. I finally captured the front of the one my church is in and it became today's photo <3

This location opened in mid-November 2024. It was the weekend after I came home from a trip to California. I had been praying about where I should be attending church. I hadn't been in physical church since June 2024. I had been virtually attending various churches after having left theChapel.

Well, the week I decided to go back to a physical church coincided with this satellite location of theChapel opening up just down the street from my apartment complex. At first, I thought it was a good option to get back into going to physical church again. It has since become my church home again...hehehe
