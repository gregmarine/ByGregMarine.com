# 2025, February 14

It's interesting to see new life in February. Florida is one of those places where new life appears all year round. Today's photo shows me something new.

I walk around the pond a lot...hehehe But I see new things all the time. I've spotted the growth of new cones on these pines several times throughout the year. I've even taken some photos on multiple occasions.

I'm glad today's photo features them finally...hehehe
