# 2025, February 15

Today, I spent a large portion of the day at Walt Disney World. I went there to enjoy a meal at Mama Melrose since it is closing for good in May. That's at Hollywood Studios. Also at HS? Gertie!

This dino at the edge of the pond is iconic for Disney's Hollywood Studios...hehehe It's a *little* ice cream spot in one of Mickey's *ears*. From the air, there is a giant hidden Mickey. This pond is one of the ears...hehehe I have several photos and videos of Gertie from my many visits.

I also captured an eclipse photo of Gertie...hehehe I sent this one to my deer friend since dinosaurs are one of her favorite things. By the way, today, it was tough choosing the photo. At the end, I had 3 I couldn't decided between. I reached out to my deer friend to have her choose 1, 2, 3 without telling her what the numbers meant...LOL She chose 2. The above picture was that choice. The below picture is the eclipse photo I sent to her earlier in the day...hehehe
