Although I wasn't home all day and did get photos away from home, today's photo still comes from home...hehehe

This gutter is right outside of my bedroom window...hehehe When it rains, I can hear the water coming out of the gutter. It's one of the reasons I use a white noise app from my phone when I sleep...LOL But when I'm not trying to sleep, I enjoy the sound of the rain and the flow of water down the gutter. It's very calming <3
