I realized yesterday that I think I only have 6 photos this year from somewhere other than my apartment complex. I need to venture out more if I'm going to keep this up...LOL

I took a few videos to capture some photos from. I ended up with quite a variety of shots to choose from. But the choice was easy. It was from a not-so-casual stroll...hehehe I was walking in a cross step pattern having a little fun...hehehe
