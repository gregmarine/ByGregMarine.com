One of the great things about living in Florida is that the Bird of Paradise plants bloom year round...hehehe

Although I went on a few walks today, I didn't capture much. I spent most of the walks praying and just taking in the moment. I started capturing such moments so I could relive them. So I can't really say why I didn't capture much today...hehehe

That said, today's photo is one of my favorites of the 42 days I've been doing this <3 These beautiful plants are one of my grandmother's favorites. Seeing them all the time reminds me of her <3 I'm very blessed to still have her in my life. When she passes from this life and into God's Kingdom eternally, I'll still have these constant reminders of the blessing that she is in my life.

When someone makes an impact on your life, it's always good to have moments that can reconnect you to cherished memories.
