# 2025, February 10

Every so often, the moon and sun are on opposite sides of the sky. When this happens, the moon seems as bright during the day as it does at night. My ability to capture images cannot do the view justice. But I do my best...hehehe

I took several of the moon this evening on my walk just before dinner. I'm so glad I went outside to see it. I was a little awestruck...hehehe One of many lessons I've learned in the last few years is to stop and pay attention. Sights like the moon tonight are worth taking in <3

I have a social media friend from *across the pond* in the UK who I share a moon bond with. A few years back, he posted about how the moon needed a name. Since it is our only moon, it is simply referred to as *the moon*...LOL Other planets with multiple moons have various names for their moons. I replied to his post and named the moon after him...LOL Ever since, we will randomly post a photo of the moon and say hello to each other. He isn't on Twitter/X anymore. So I posted one of my other photos of the moon from tonight on Bluesky where we remain connected. He's on Instagram and Threads now too. But we typically only chat over Bluesky at the moment. He'll wake up to my post tomorrow...hehehe
