On many of my evening walks lately, the seagulls have been visiting the pond I walk around. When they are chatting, they sound like they are laughing...LOL I suppose I'm funny to look at...HAHAHA j/k.

Today's photo represents these gulls of the sea. They typically swoop down and get a drink of water from the pond. At least, that's what it looks like. They scoop it up and keep on flying. It's really neat. I haven't been able to capture that on video very well, though. They often then perch up on the top of the buildings next to the pond. But the two in today's photo flew off instead. The one on the left cast a shadow on the wall. So, it was like having 3 birds...hehehe

I post these on Instagram; which in turn posts them to Threads and Facebook. On the Instagram post, however, I include a song. Today's song was *Feed the Birds* from *Mary Poppins*...hehehe
