I had a very pleasant walk today. I actually had a few walks. But on my first one, I captured several things that I saw. One of them became today's photo <3 It was nice to be outside! It finally feels like normal Florida winter today...LOL

This is a [Brazilian peppertree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinus_terebinthifolia) I think. AKA *Florida holly*...HAHAHA According to it's Wikipedia article, this is illegal in Florida...hehehe Perhaps I should let someone know it needs to be destroyed?!? It's an invasive species that doesn't belong here. But it sure is pretty...hehehe

One of the great things about capturing things like this is that I get to learn more about them. If it really is a Brazilian peppertree species, I should definitely alert the property management. The Florida Department of Agriculture will want to know about this.
