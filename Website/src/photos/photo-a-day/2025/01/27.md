I captured quite a bit on one of my walks today. I took several of various things I hadn't ventured to try before. I may do similar again in the future since I only pick 1 photo each day. And I don't feature any of the other photos after that day. Although, I may still use those other photos for other things someday...hehehe Plus, I've thought about sharing the other photos here on this site on the day I take them...just below the featured photo, of course...hehehe

This is my first semi-selfie as a featured photo. When capturing something different, I noticed my reflection. I started to do things like thumbs up, peace sign, and the *I love you* sign. When I did this peace sign, I liked how you can see my fingers in the foreground and my *selfie* out of focus in the background. This is at a storm drain to/from the pond I normally walk around.The sky had a really neat reflection off the water. It is angled in such a way that I could stand on the edge of the drain and capture things like this...hehehe
