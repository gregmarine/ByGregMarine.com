# 2025, January 31

For a few mornings this month, I've tried to capture the sunrise over the mall across from the apartment complex and over the fitness center we have. I do it from my patio. I like the view from there. Today's photo finally made the cut...hehehe

I love how this one looks like a cross. I wasn't intentionally going for that. I was just capturing the sun and its reflection off the pool. And then it just sort of happened. I think the screen on my patio helps give it that *star* sun glare through the tiny square holes. But I'm not sure.

It was great seeing this view just before I started work today. It helped set the tone for the day...hehehe
