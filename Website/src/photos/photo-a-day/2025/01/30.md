Once again, I only got outside for one walk today. But I did capture a lot. I had 9 potential photos to choose from today...hehehe This one is the winner!

I stopped to listen and watch this little warbler. After a bit, I got my camera out. When I did, he flew off. I was able to grab this still image from his flight. Two of today's candidate photos came from that. This one wins because you can truly see its form.

I love the warblers around here. I can hear their song most days when I walk around the pond. I sometimes pretend they are talking to me. They have quite a bit to say...hehehe They are truly a blessing.
