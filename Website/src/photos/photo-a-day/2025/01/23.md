Today's photo comes from my bathroom...HAHAHA It was another *inside* day for this guy...LOL I had a little bit of fun with the new (to me) app, [Prequel](https://prequel.app). The photo for today was the result of one of the experiments I did.

I love how this turned out. It reminds me of an old 50s vintage photograph of an actual beach lighthouse. On Instagram, I matched this up with *Heart & Soul* for the music. I was feeling a little nostalgic.

My parents sent me this little lighthouse thing as a housewarming gift when I moved to Florida. Two of my lighthouses are from them...hehehe Here is the original picture of this one.

It has been in my bathroom all these years of Florida life. I love it and it always reminds me of my parents.

Just for fun, I applied an AI filter in Prequel...hehehe It turned it into an art piece made of odds and ends you might find in a beach house. I would love to have used this version for today's photo. But nothing in the photo actually exists. It is real in that the source is real. But it doesn't represent reality. It only represents my artsy fun side.

I suppose I don't find anything wrong with that. But since it is AI and goes beyond a simple filter, I didn't post it on my socials. Plus, some artists out there aren't happy with AI art. I see value in all types of art. I can appreciate it all since it does require human interaction to produce even AI art. Of course, it doesn't hold the same value as how a more traditional piece of work is created...LOL I don't sell art, though. This piece is priceless because it costs nothing...HAHAHA But seriously, as long as it holds value for *me*, it has some value.
