# 2025, January 24

Well, I was out for a little today...LOL I only did 2 laps around the pond all day in two attempts...LOL It's too cold. But I hear it will warm up to above normal next week. Weather is weird...LOL Anyway, today's photo is from outside!

This is a [wood stork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_stork). It is a large bird compared to some of the others I see around here. The only other birds I've seen that are large are the bald eagle and the great blue heron. And then there was that one time I *think* I saw a golden eagle.

This poor guy was resting when I came upon him. I grabbed my camera just in time to capture this moment of him taking off. I don't like to disturb the wildlife. But when they are that close to you, just being there is a disruption. So, I couldn't avoid it.

It had a beautiful flight as it left my sight today. I'm so blessed to live in a place that has so many species of birds. And they're here all year. We even get those migratory birds that come down from the north during the winters here.
