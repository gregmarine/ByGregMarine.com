# 2025, January 25

As today was the end of my fast from coffee, I decided to choose my *grateful* coffee mug. As it sat there with my Bible and cross, I captured the moment. That moment became today's photo.

I bought that Bible sometime last year. All of my previous Bibles were lost in a flood years ago. I had been using the Bible app exclusively since that happened. But last year, I decided to get physical Bibles again. This was the third one I got and is now my primary source for study.

The cross you see in the photo was a Christmas present from my deerest friend. I love that cross. I have it with me when I am sitting at my desk studying and praying. I sometimes take it to my bedroom while I sleep. It has been a faithful companion this past month <3

The mug was a Christmas present from my parents. So, I have also had it for a month. It has become my favorite mug. It best represents the condition of my heart lately.

I am grateful and Blessed <3
