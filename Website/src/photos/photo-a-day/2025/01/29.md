# 2025, January 29

With it being a busy day at work, I only got outside once. I would have liked to have gotten out a bit more. But I appreciate what I saw today. Even though it was slim pickin's for a photo, I still love this one <3

I've taken photos of this tall grass before. But it's typically when the sun is rising just over the mall behind it. The sunbeams gleam through the grass in such photos. It was nice to capture what it looks like when the sky is overcast. I feel it is equally beautiful.

We need the contrast views in life. It isn't always sunny. It isn't always rainy. A good balance of perspectives have a way of warming the heart. I just need to appreciate the moment <3
