# 2025, January 21

Today's photo was from inside. The weather just wasn't fit for my daily walks...hehehe I took a few videos throughout the day. But I ended up going with this one for the photo.

This is what a Florida winter looks like in the Tampa Bay area. It is a bit gloomy. It was rainy. It was cold. That's about it. I'm grateful for the rain as it doesn't rain much in the winter here. The sun will be back very soon. They don't call this the Sunshine State for nothing...HAHAHA The warmth won't be back immediately. But it won't be long before it returns too.
