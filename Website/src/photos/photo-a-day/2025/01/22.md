Another day of being inside all day meant I took my photo videos from inside again...LOL I didn't have much to choose from today. It was a busy day and I didn't look at much...LOL

As I was pouring my hot water for my evening snack, I thought I'd capture it. I'm glad to be using videos to do my photography for shots like this. That water was pretty hot and I shouldn't be fumbling around with a camera while I'm pouring...LOL But doing a video allowed me to concentrate on the water and just hope for the best. I thought it was good enough for this capture and it became the photo for today...hehehe
