I had planned to find a photo from the videos I captured throughout the day...hehehe Well, I accidentally took a few photos while trying to video record a bird...LOL So, the one photo that actually had the bird in it became the photo for today...HAHAHA

This is a [Great-tailed grackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-tailed_grackle), I think. I see these all the time. In the video I actually did capture, I sent it to my deer friend with a joke about how the audioanimatronics seem so real...HAHAHA That seems like a dad joke...but I got the joke from a kid...LOL
