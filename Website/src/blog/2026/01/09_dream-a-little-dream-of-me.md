# Dream a Little Dream of Me

## Yearbook

I had a dream last night about something which dates back 30 years. My brother was quite active in school. In his senior yearbook, he is literally on every page that wasn't student and faculty portraits. He was an editor for the yearbook that year and protested his being on every activities page, but his co-editor insisted. What this shows is that he truly lived that year and didn't waste a moment. He continues to live that way today.

My senior yearbook only has two photos of me: my portrait and one in the broadcast class. I didn't do anything else that year. I didn't apply myself to my school work. I did just enough to graduate. I frustrated my teachers and parents. I was the smartest in my class, but I was also the most bored. I "gave up" and coasted because school just "wasn't for me".

Then it hit me at graduation. I somewhat regretted how I treated the school experience and was brought to tears. That is when my nostalgia was born. To this day, I have some feelings of "regret" about my "yearbook." The dream last night was a good reminder to live in the moment and not look too far forward and miss what Blessing "now" is.

Back then, I was so ready for what was next that I missed what I had. I am still "suffering" the consequences of that today. I no longer really feel "regret" per se. The true feeling is that I've learned from these things. When I say "regret," I am simply acknowledging the sadness.

I no longer have that yearbook. Somewhere along my journey, a box was lost, but the memories remain. The dream was so vivid that I could even feel the emotions I had 30 years ago. It was as if I were reliving an experience that made an impact on who I have become.

## Live for the Moment

There’s this question of "what if you knew you only had one day left to live, what would you do?" There are generally a small set of answers. I recently saw someone say, "Jesus knew, and He washed feet." That’s a great point.

Well, with how I’m feeling today, and this week in general, I’m starting to think I should be asking myself, "what if this is my last moment?" And live for the moment as if it were my last. That’s not to say I shouldn’t care about things. On the contrary. It beckons me to seek God’s will for "this" moment. Every moment is a gift. And He wills every moment He gives <3

## Ignorance and Want

As I was reading Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" for the first time this past Christmas season, something stood out. And I was reminded of it in the middle of the night with that dream about the yearbook. At the end of the second spirit's visit, the *Ghost of Christmas Present*, there are two children at his feet under his robe. They are named *Ignorance* (the boy) and *Want* (the girl). Not many of the movies I've seen have included this part. But it seems like a very pivotal and important piece to the story. So I'm glad I read the original work and rediscovered them. They somewhat provide a segue to the third spirit.

*Ignorance* is the one to fear most. On his brow was written *Doom*. This is the state of being unaware, unteachable, and willfully blind to the truth and needs of the moment. Being ignorant of what is needed in the moment can lead me to ruin. And it has many times in my life. Although the warning in the book was for society, I connect with it and was reminded of it in my dream last night.

*Want*, although not necessarily as bad as *Ignorance*, represents the physical state of poverty and the lack of basic needs. Again, something associated with society in the book, but equal to be heeded in my own life. Spiritually speaking, remaining *ignorant* can lead to *want*. But there is also this idea that if I want what I don't have and see it as a *need*, I could be going after what isn't meant for me. That ignorance can lead to real want as well.

## Wrapping Up

This has been an interesting day, and week. Today's thoughts were quite unexpected. I'm glad I have the journaling process I have right now. It has helped me pray about and process these things. My whole week as been like this, actually.

I've been working on the art piece that was inspired by this week's Bible study theme. I'm not quite *finished* just yet. But I really like how it is going.

For this month, instead of swapping out my little 4x4 inch paintings on my little art shelf, I've decided to leave my Christmas cards. Most of them arrived very close to or after Christmas. I didn't want them to go away so quickly. I'll put them away when I pick February's paintings...hehehe
