# Not Just a Hobby

This week, I'm doing my mornings a little differently. I read "today's" scripture from the Bible study reading plan and then spend at least 10 mins meditating on some life decisions I'm facing. This is so that I listen to the Holy Spirit on those things in a more focused and intentional way. Focus is an area of weakness for me. So I'm glad to be setting this time aside each morning this week to remind me of the importance of focus.

I'm in my daily morning meeting. It is becoming noise lately. I like the routine of it. But it is diminishing in value. It began as a nice way to focus my day. Yet now, here I am writing in my journal while the other guys are chatting... LOL

Should I speak up about the lack of focus in this meeting now? I mean later. But "now" as opposed to how this meeting used to be.

I just finished my weekly 1:1 with my supervisor. It was edifying. We didn't have much to talk about that was specific to work. So we spent much of the time talking philosophy and AI. I enjoy an intellectual conversation that helps us both grow as people.

Now it's time for coffee and toast!

## 12:35p

It has been a productive morning despite that one meeting earlier. I like days when things just click. Especially when it helps others do their jobs. Most of what I've done today has been support tickets to resolve a few issues on an app I support. They have been configuration issues. So quick fixes. But they make a huge impact.

I'll break for lunch soon. I may watch some TV while I eat. I don't watch much these days... hehehe

## 04:25p

My afternoon has been less productive. I've been working on the same task and have run into a roadblock. My brain is done braining for work today... LOL Validating data in a web app doesn't seem easy for me anymore. There are libraries that are supposed to make it easier. But this "old dog" finds the old ways easier... LOL I may just roll my own solution tomorrow... LOL

The tacos were really good tonight. I wanted to do something different this time. So, I asked Cherie how she does her chicken. I went with something similar. I didn't have lemon pepper on hand. So I did regular pepper. Everything else was about the same I think.

I'm going to do today's Bible study session now. This morning, I just read the passage. Now I'm going to study and reflect on it.

## 08:45p

All finished with the Bible study and I've sketched out this week's artwork. I'm going to try to make this one look like stained glass. The main shapes will be based on curves. But I'll use straight lines to fill it in. And then I'll alternate shades of color to mimic the stained glass look. It should be fun!

I also did more work on a piece I began last night. It's coming along nicely.

I needed a break. So I'll watch a bit more TV... hehehe

## 10:15p

Overall, today was a really good day. I'm glad I did this timestamp entry. It isn't exhaustive. But it was nice to go back and reflect on my day this evening.

I'm grateful for the artwork I'm doing. It isn't just a hobby. It's expression. It's part of me. And part of me is in it too.
