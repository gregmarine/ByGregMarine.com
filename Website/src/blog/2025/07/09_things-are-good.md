# Things are Good

Well, I've had tacos 3 nights this week so far...LOL Did I mention I missed tacos?!? HAHAHA j/k

Something else that seems to be back so far is my late night schedule. I've been staying up later this week...hehehe I suppose that's good for my upcoming California trip. Plus it seems that I'm doing more each day again. I remember when I first did this shifted schedule last year and how much more I seemed to do everyday. Well, it isn't so much *how much* I get done each day. It's more about how I feel less rushed to do everything I love doing each day. Which is also less stressful. So, I'm actually just more productive...LOL

A few months ago, I cut down how much I've been walking. But then this week, I seem to be back up to 3 miles. This time, I'm doing all 3 miles in the evening. Earlier this year, I would do 3 one mile walks throughout the day. I had cut that down to just a single 1 mile walk in the evening. I didn't plan to start walking 3 miles again, though...LOL It just sort of started happening.

I am back to my weekly call with mom and dad, too. I hadn't called them in a while...mostly because I was visiting them in Indiana...LOL Last week, I didn't call because I had just finished my visit a few days prior...hehehe So, tonight, I gave them a call. We talked for just over an hour. It was great to talk to them <3

This weekend, I'm hoping to get my car's oil change done. And I hope to get a new driver's license photo taken. A couple of much needed chores...hehehe The photo on my license is from over 3 years ago...and over 80 lbs ago...LOL I've been having some trouble getting through TSA lately. Especially before my last flight. With my upcoming trips, I wanted to get a more updated photo of what I look like now. The car thing is just because it is finally time for it...hehehe

Work has been going really well this week. I've been very productive. It has been hard to get back to my rhythm after *Big Bang* weekend in May. But this week, things seem to be going really well. I've had 3 really good days overall. Not just with work. Everything is good this week...hehehe Maybe it's this sleep schedule? Hmmm...hehehe

Something else that I'm enjoying this week is *The Chosen* devotional, book 5. We're 3 days into it. It had been so long since we've done the devotionals that I had forgotten how much I loved the format <3

Each episode of *The Chosen* has a round table discussion about the episode that has a Catholic priest, a Jewish Rabbi, and an Evangelical Bible scholar discussing the content. Something I enjoy most about those is how they go into historical details. The show doesn't claim to be 100% accurate. It claims to be *based on* the Bible and they insist on people going to the Bible itself for Truth. But the *based on* part is where the round tables are helpful. I only started watching those in season 3. So, now I'm going back to the earlier seasons to catch up. They are well worth a watch and I'm glad they are available.

With season 3, they started doing an *after show* where they interview the cast and writers. Those are fun too. I'm looking forward to when those and the round tables for season 5 become available.

I didn't realize those existed until we were doing the season 3 Bible study...hehehe I was like "*Ooohhh!!! More ~The Chosen~ content?!? Yes, please!*" HAHAHA I think the show and the supporting content have been good for me. It has encouraged me to dive deeper into God's Word and the history of *His People*. It has help bring me more context to the Bible; which has helped me understand things better. The show is entertaining. The research and study it has directed me to has been enlightening.

It's a bit sad that the show has caused so much controversy. But I get it. If someone were to only watch the show, they wouldn't get the whole picture. Not everyone has the *Berean* spirit to go search out the Truth. The parable of the sower comes to mind here. So, when I talk about the show with people, I go further and explain these other things I do around the show to offer encouragement for them to dive deeper too.

Side note: Dallas Jenkins, and the other *The Chosen* folks, continually express my thoughts on this too. They always talk about going to the *source* and that this is *just a show*. But the show itself doesn't actually tell people to dive deeper.

Anyway, I love *The Chosen* and look forward to everything they have yet to do. There are still 2 more seasons to make before it is complete. And they have other projects they are working on now. I pray for them and, what I call, their ministry.

I hope to go back to making fried rice soon. I miss that too. The tacos have been great. I'm almost ready for rice again...LOL I could also go for some spaghetti...hehehe Ooh, and those mushroom burgers...YUM! I really missed cooking at home...HAHAHA
