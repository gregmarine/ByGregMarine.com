# Do I love America (USA)?

Yesterday, [Isaac Saul](https://www.readtangle.com/author/isaac-saul/) sent out a personal essay titled [*Do I love America?*](https://www.readtangle.com/do-i-love-america/) through his newsletter, [*Tangle*](https://www.readtangle.com). I appreciate his thoughts on this country. And it got me to asking myself the same question. *Do I love America?*

Yes, yes I do. I love this country very much, actually. I love it in a similar way that I love my son, family, and friends. And very similar to how I love God. Not in that order, of course. I love God first and foremost. My son, family, and friends right after God. And then my country way down past other things I also love. But *how* I love the United States of America is very similar.

I don't love everything about this country. Just like I don't love everything about anyone. We all have our weaknesses. The same goes for the *good old US of A*. She's 249 this year. She doesn't look a day over 239. But this country sure does have a lot of problems. This year, well, things have gotten worse.

I don't see the end of this country coming anytime soon, though. What is going on right now will pass. Things come and go all the time. There isn't anything new under the sun. I see a day coming with *this too shall pass*. Things will get worse. But then things will get better. That's how it has always been with the USA since day one.

So, I still love the USA. It is my home. I wish it wasn't so divided right now. And I wish people would be kinder to each other. Even if someone is here illegally, they are still human after all. These ICE raids are causing my soul to be troubled. And the cuts coming to health aid are a problem too. People aren't being tried well and that makes me sad.
