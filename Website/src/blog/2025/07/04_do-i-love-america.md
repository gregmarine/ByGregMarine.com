# Do I love America?

Yesterday, [Isaac Saul](https://www.readtangle.com/author/isaac-saul/) sent out a personal essay titled [*Do I love America?*](https://www.readtangle.com/do-i-love-america/) through his newsletter, [*Tangle*](https://www.readtangle.com). I appreciate his thoughts on this country. And it got me to asking myself the same question. *Do I love America?*

Yes, yes I do. I love this country very much, actually. I love it in a similar way that I love my son, family, and friends. And very similar to how I love God. Not in that order, of course. I love God first and foremost. My son, family, and friends right up against God. And then my country way down past other things I also love. But *how* I love the United States of America is very similar.
