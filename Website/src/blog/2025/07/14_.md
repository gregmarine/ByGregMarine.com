## Morning

I didn't sleep well last night. I was asleep by 1am. I woke off and on throughout the night and was praying. I started to wake for the day before 7am. By 7:12am, I was wide awake. All last week, I was asleep by 1am and didn't wake until about 7:45am. That was the case up through yesterday. Except maybe Saturday? I think I got up earlier that day because I needed to go in for my drivers license...hehehe I'm not really sure why I was so restless last night, though. Nothing that was concerning me was on my mind before bed. I didn't read last night. Could that be the reason? I was watching a round table discussion for S3E3 of *The Chosen* up until about 12:15am.

Reading fiction or watching an entertaining TV show helps me disengage my mind. But reading non-fiction or watching something that takes me deep into an important topic keeps my mind engaged. I'll have to be mindful of this. I hadn't really thought about that much. I used to watch TV before bed. I stopped doing that a while ago when I fasted TV once. Lately, I've been reading fiction before bed and that had the same affect as TV used to. But I'm preferring reading over TV now that I'm reading so much. It feels healthier...LOL

I'm one who can wind my mind down reading or watching something for entertainment. It doesn't stimulate my mind at all. The round table discussions from *The Chosen* are amazing and very engaging for me, though. Something else I did last night was did a deeper dive into the word *hate* as used in Luke 14:26. It was part of one of our devotionals last week. We talked about it yesterday and then I decided to find out what the original Greek said and what it might have meant back when Jesus said it. Matthew recounts the same message but states it differently than Luke. That led me to looking into Luke's writing style.

I have learned that each book's author had a style. And some books have varying styles within the same book. It depended on what the author was trying to convey to the reader at the time. Some of that gets lost in translation unless we research those things closer. Doing that research so late last night also stimulated my mind quite a bit. I'll not go deep into it here, but Luke often used hyperbole in his writing. And so did Jesus when He spoke. Luke wrote that as Jesus may have said it. Whereas Matthew's style shifted to a less hyperbolic tone.

Essentially, Jesus was simply saying that if we love others more than Him, we can't really be His disciple. *Hate* in the full context of His lesson is more about *to love less than* more so than what we view as hate today; which is what Matthew describe it as. Interesting, and engaging, stuff...hehehe

Tonight, I need to remember to either do nothing, or just read one of my fiction books...LOL
