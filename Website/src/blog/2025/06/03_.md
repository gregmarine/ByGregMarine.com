# TBD

I've missed journaling...LOL As I look back at May, I didn't journal a lot. It was a busy month...hehehe Now it's June and I'm still finding it difficult to make time to journal. That's okay. I'm making the time tonight...hehehe

First things first...Malachi graduated high school! Yay!!! And with his Core 40 diploma!!! Extra YAY!!! He had a tough high school career. But he completed it well. I'm one very proud dad! His health hasn't been great for almost 3 years now. So, those last few years of his scheduled time in high school were rough. He had to extend to a fifth year of school to complete it. And complete it he did!

His final year was through a special online school. So, he was able to complete the work from home at his leisure. Also, it was setup so that he could test out of homework. He had already taken all of the classes in the school in his city. But he didn't pass them because he was too sick to attend regularly and get assignments in on time. His old school didn't allow him to work virtually from home. By taking the tests instead at this new school, he was able to prove he had the knowledge. I'm grateful this school existed for him. And it was God timing. This was the inaugural year for this particular school! God provided just what Malachi needed at just the right time he needed it <3

After his graduation, I headed back home. So, I've been home for the last 3 days getting back into my routine. Sort of...hehehe I'm being less routine oriented at the moment. With the Big Bang schedule for a few weeks, plus my trip to Indiana, I haven't had much of a set routine for awhile. This week, I'm somewhat going with the flow. It's like I'm ride the tail end of the wave that has been my life for about a month...LOL And I'd have to say I really like it.

Something I started doing yesterday was logging what I've been doing. I setup a notebook on my Kindle Scribe to track things at a high level. I don't track what I'm doing at work. But I am tracking things like when I get up, how much sleep I got, when I eat and what I've had for meals, and when I do various activities like walks and Bible stuff. I even logged when I started writing this journal entry...LOL I'll do this for a little while and see if I can garner any insights into my life. Find if there is a routine to be set or if I like the randomness of what I've been doing for weeks...hehehe

Yesterday was my niece's birthday. Sweet 16! Someone, I imagine her parents, gave her a kayak for her birthday...hehehe She texted me and said she'd like to join me sometime. Funny thing is I was beginning to feel like I'd have to give up kayaking...LOL But I have a renew hope in being able to get back on the water if she'll join me. She also wants to hit up Disney...hehehe Perhaps we'll get to work out some sort of special uncle/niece trip or something. Maybe her dad, my brother, can join us too! He loves to do these 1 on 1 things with each of his kids. And my niece and nephews love to have their Uncle Greg around. They invite me to things when they come down and I gratefully accept when I am available...hehehe

Today is Katie's birthday. I haven't seen her in months. I sent her a text this morning wishing her a happy birthday. I remember spending the day with her on her special day 2 years ago. It was a really fun day. I miss having times like that with friends. It's too bad that didn't really work out past 2023. I saw her a few months ago when I met up with a few other friends. It was good to see her again. Maybe someday I'll get to hang out with her at Disney again. Although our friendship isn't like what it was before, it isn't completely lost.
