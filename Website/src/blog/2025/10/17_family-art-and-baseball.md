## 9:35am

I didn't sleep well last night. But I feel fine at the moment. I have this feeling that this hasn't been a good month for me. It's half over and I've had more bad days than good. I'd say I'm okay with that, though.

I took a break from writing yesterday. I still wrote on social media. Especially a few replies on Reddit that were lengthy. But that isn't the same as *writing*. I almost didn't post a featured photo. And I struggled to find something to say with it. I posted anyway. Consistency has helped me grow. So even when I'm not *feeling* it, I'm glad when I do *something* with that. I didn't force myself to post.

I didn't want to do a timestamp entry today. But I accidentally started one...LOL

## 10:15am

One of the times I woke up last night, I pondered the thought of casting one of my new color e-ink tablets to a screen while doing art so I could see the *true* colors. I could paint on the tablet and occasionally look at the monitor to evaluate in real-time. It gives my brain what it needs to create, while also helping me see what the *true* results are becoming. As it turns out, it is super simple to do the screen casting to another device. And the orientation matches whichever I'm viewing the tablet. Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that...LOL I can't wait to work on a piece using these new techniques <3

The piece I made a few days ago, "Distracted", I plan to have printed on canvas so I can display it in my home. Plus, it will be nice to see my virtual work become physical. I did that with a work a few years ago as a birthday gift for Katie I named "Bring Me Thrawn". It was Ahsoka with a pair of lightsabers in a dark woods from Star Wars...hehehe It was inspired by the TV show they made about the character. I did it in a cartoon style based on a t-shirt design of the character I once saw. I created it in Procreate on my iPad and then had it printed on metal. I loved how it turned out.

Today is...going...LOL

But today has given way to thinking. I sure do love to think...LOL I did a lot of thinking yesterday as well. Taking a general break from writing was nice. But I could have written a lot. I'm choosing not to write deep thoughts today. At least so far.

I hope to spend some time on my most recent short story. I'd like to get that first draft complete. I'd also like to work on some sketches and paintings. And there's that LEGO tree that would like me to build it...hehehe I think this will be a good weekend for these things.

One of my Reddit replies yesterday was to answer the question of which *pen* I use to write on my Supernote tablets. I went into detail about the 7 *pens* I have and what I use each for. It was fun to think about and explain. I actually only use 6 of them. The 7ᵗʰ is the Wacom One stylus. My brain hates it. I should sell it or give it to someone. Also, those 7 do not account for the 2 that came with the new tablets I just got. But I don't write with either of those.

I sometimes miss going to Zen kitchen. I haven't been in months. I'lI likely not go anytime soon.

I'm enjoying the MLB playoffs more this year than last. My family has been sharing the experience with me this year. Everyone wants LA to be in the World Series. But the ALCS has a bit of rivalry in the family. My sister and I want the Blue Jays and our parents want the Mariners...LOL They are tied going into tonight's game. But LA is likely to sweep in their game against the Brewers. Here's hoping!

Malachi told me today that he wants a drawing tablet for Christmas...hehehe I'll be researching the one he is asking for <3

## 1:20pm

I'm really glad I'm writing today. And I'm glad it ended up being a timestamp entry. This is making my heart happy <3

## 4:10pm

The drawing tablet Malachi is eyeing looks to be pretty good for the price.

## 4:30pm

Malachi called as I was writing that last time-stamp...hehehe

I watched some reviews on the tablet he is asking for. I almost bought one for myself so I could help him with his...LOL I canceled...LOL He'll be getting it from my parents if he gets it for Christmas. I don't need one to help him. Since it uses Android, I can use the same apps that he'll use from my current tablets.

I ended up buying a laptop stand to hold my Tab X C when using it as a *desktop* computer. It is so much more stable now. And I think I'll try it as an easel for when I'm doing artwork on my tablets.

## 9:20pm

Well, the Mariners won after I switched over to the Dodgers game... LOL The Blue Jays were winning before I switched. Coincidence?! HAHAHA I suppose it doesn't matter who wins the ALCS. Whoever wins will lose to LA in the World Series! LOL j/k I don't know the future...HAHAHA

I enjoyed my salmon tacos tonight. They were probably the best way I've prepared fish tacos. I marinated the salmon in ginger lime coco aminos. I used a mango pineapple salsa. And 'kraut, of course. I drank a lemon lime soda and had jalapeno lime tortilla chips.

I watched a little TV tonight. Both episodes were disappointing...LOL Some shows just aren't entertaining anymore. I guess that just makes good TV look better...LOL

I'd like to see about using my Tab X C as an external monitor for my MacBook this weekend. I know it's possible. But I'll see how useful that is...hehehe I'll be using the new stand tonight when I go to post this.

The Dodgers are doing well tonight. The game will still be in progress when I post this. So hopefully they'll be NLCS champs after *this* is out there...hehehe

I'd like to finish journaling our August vacation this weekend. Our next vacation is only a month away...LOL

## 10:20pm

Malachi called me 3 times today. I'm really glad I was able to talk to him so much. I always appreciate when I get such opportunities. He also called my mom. He was pretty excited to ask her for the drawing tablet for Christmas. And she was excited he wants one. So I'm pretty sure that's what she and dad will be getting for him. I'm very excited about it too. He's been drawing more lately and I think he's really good. He holds back a little because he doesn't like to waste paper. With a digital notepad, he can draw as much as he wants. I look forward to seeing what comes of this <3

The morning was...yeah. But the rest of the day was really good. I'm looking forward to what this weekend has in store <3

## 11:05pm

It has taken me a while to proofread this entry. I've been watching the game. Plus I'm still getting used to this new setup using the TAB X C as the final review and post stage. Honestly, I would still be taking a while if I were on my MacBook tonight...LOL The game has been fun to watch...LOL It isn't quite over yet. But it looks really good for LA.
