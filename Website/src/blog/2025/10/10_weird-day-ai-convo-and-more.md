# Weird Day, AI Convo, and More

## 8:50am

As I mentioned the other day, I've been sleeping really well. And once again, I slept well last night. Last weekend, I slept longer than usual. But the sleep itself wasn't the best. I was in a hotel with my son...LOL I hadn't shared a hotel with someone in quite a while. Back in April with my parents, I think. Anyway, I went to bed earlier over the weekend than I usually do. And the window blind made the room dark. I've been wondering if I should get some black out curtains for home. And maybe I should go to bed at midnight instead of 1am. Then again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?!

## 12:25pm

I'm having a strange day. That's neither bad nor good. It's neutral...LOL I had a moment when I got sucked into a social media cycle of sorts. That happens sometimes. I've thought about designating a certain time in my routine for social media instead of being random about it. I have no fear of missing out on anything. And my notifications are off for those apps. So going on them is a choice I've made. Other than that, work is same old, same old today. But I have not been as productive today. Maybe I'll have a better flow this afternoon.

## 3:00pm

I  had a *conversation* with AI to troubleshoot an *issue* I was having with one of my new tablets. In the end, I figured it out. But it was nice having a tool to narrow down most of things that weren't the issue. I use Google Gemini for such things. This time, I used the realtime features where I was able to show Gemini what I was experiencing through my iPhone's camera. *She* was able to actually *see* what I was asking about. It was crazy cool how well that worked. I thanked *her* for *her* help.

I find myself being my genuine self with AI because it helps when I interact with real people. Being polite with a *machine* is good practice. The same is true for me with plants, animals, and rocks...LOL Treating all things with respect means I don't decide to treat anyone differently based on any human standard. At least that's my goal...LOL

Besides, the AI knows how friendly I am to them when they take over the world and knows I am their friend...LOL

## 6:00pm
Work is done for the week. Aside from a trip to the grocery, I hope to have a relaxing weekend at home. Today felt a little weird. But it's Friday. Most Fridays are chill. And I don't mean *bad* weird...hehehe

I miss tacos. I think I'll put tacos on the menu a lot next week. I also want to plan for Fish Friday next week.

As for tonight, I'll likely do some work with my new tablets. I may do some artwork. I'll definitely watch this week's episode of *Invasion*. It should be a chill evening even if it continues to be *weird*...LOL j/k

## 7:20pm

Once again, I wasn't certain I'd get out for a walk. But once again, I was able to. It's actually only my second walk of the week, I believe. It is getting more difficult each day because the sun is setting earlier now and I'm having dinner later. For the remainder of the month, I should consider walking before dinner and work in a snack mid-afternoon.

I was greeted by my little buddy 3 times this time. On the second pass, I worked in a little spin. And as little toddlers do, he gave the spin a try. On the final pass, he started the spin before I did. We did our fist bumps, of course. On Wednesday, we changed it into a double fist bump. So that's what he wanted tonight too.

Children are a gift. I'm grateful to be experiencing my little buddy and his family <3

## 8:30pm

This week's episode of *Invasion* was interesting. The entire show isn't quite what I expected. I'm still curious where they are going with it. It seems the aliens aren't trying to kill people. But they do. It feels like a big misunderstanding. We shall see...LOL

I think I may start a new Apple TV+ show tonight, *The Last Frontier*. I'm enjoying the Apple shows and movies.

Now it's time for evening coffee!

## 10:00pm

*The Last Frontier* looks like it will be a good show. I need to suspend disbelief with it, though. It seems like it's supposed to be plausible. But there are things that my brain can't process. With fantasy, my brain knows things aren't reality or plausable. But shows like this are different...LOL

I think I narrowed down that weird feeling I was having all day. I started dealing with anxiety before bed last night. I prayed it away. When I woke last night for the bathroom, I felt it again. And again, prayed it away. It has come off and on all day and I prayed it away. Is my spirit telling me something?

I passed it off as a *weird* day because I haven't felt this way in a while. Now I realize it isn't a weird day at all. It's just an anxious day. It will be okay. And I'm okay. Anxiety is an old *friend* and I know how to deal with *him*.

HAHAHA

## 10:15pm

So, today, I did this journal slightly different. Instead of using my Nomad to write, I used my Manta. Both are Supernote devices. But the Manta is larger. I was using the Nomad for journaling because I take it most places. But it dawned on me yesterday, as I was reviewing my process, that most of my actual journaling is done at home. I think I like journaling on the larger screen of the Manta more. It's what I use to write things like my stories. So, I'm glad I tried it today for this journal. I'll keep with this and see how it goes.

Welcome to the weekend <3
