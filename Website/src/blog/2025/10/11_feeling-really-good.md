# Feeling Really Good

## Morning

I decided to sleep in today. I even hit the snooze twice. I slept well and liked getting up slowly. When I woke, I did my morning time with God. I've been doing that for just over 2 years now. Before all else, including getting out of bed, I go to God in prayer. I started doing that the first weekend of October 2023. Although I prayed in the morning well before that, this has been a very intentional time since that morning just over 2 years ago.

Because I slept in, I had a late breakfast. But I've noticed my breakfasts have been getting later lately regardless of when I wake up. As a result, my lunch and dinner have shifted as well. It is working well for the time being.

I told Cherie about my anxiety. Her response was equally inspired and beautiful. This morning, I copied the entire thing into a digest so I can keep it handy. And I'd like to unpack it a bit too. I really connected with it. Although I was okay despite the anxiety I was feeling yesterday, what she said put my heart to rest. I have felt *shalom* ever since. I'm grateful for what she said. I'm grateful for its inspiration and beauty. God is so good.

I don't do this often, but I made a To-Do list for today. I want to be intentional with the time God has given me today. It isn't meant for me to be super productive. It's a simple list for me to intentional accomplish some things I'd really like to do today. This might be a good discipline to practice each day. It will help me focus. It isn't really a *task list*. Just a simple reminder. Journaling is on the list...LOL So is laundry and the grocery. I'll be working on the Bible study and hope to do some art. And that short story I'm working on.

I'm feeling really good today. I'm sure when I write this afternoon and evening, I'll be reporting the same good feelings <3

## Afternoon

The afternoon was productive. I did some of my Bible study. I got gas. I got most of my hairs cut...LOL Put air in my tires. And I did my grocery shopping for the week.

I think I've had the gal who cut my hair before back in March. It was at a different location. But that one closed shortly after I got my haircut in March. I like her better than the gal I had last month. So I may try to only go on days she's working. She does a good job and her personality is fun. The other gal was abrasive and I didn't like the way she cut. Seems weird to say. But I just get this certain feeling when someone is cutting my hair.

My grocery trip was a success. I made a list this time. If I forgot something, it would only have been because it wasn't on the list...LOL They had everything on the list. They don't always. So I was impressed. And they opened a register just as I got done. So no wait at checkout. As I left, I did realize I had forgotten that it is apple cider season now. I saw it on my way out. So I need to remember it next time. It didn't make the list and I didn't notice it on my way in. I was thinking about apple cider this morning. Just not when I made my list...LOL

I did the Bible study differently this week. That's why I'm still working on it. But the end result will be the same, I imagine. This has been a different kind of month for me. So I felt I needed a different approach to the study lesson this week. The lesson is, once again, very timely. This past week is full of anniversaries of traumatic events in my life. This lesson hits home with them all. I love how God's timing is perfect.

As expected, I'm happy to report that I'm still feeling really good this afternoon <3

## Evening

I decided to take a walk before dinner tonight. I ended up walking about 3.3 miles for around an hour. The walk inspired a Haiku (below). Although the temperature was around 80, the humidity was low and the breeze was cool. It felt like a Fall evening. It was quite peaceful and I'm glad to capture it in a poem. I wanted to work on my latest short story tonight. But the Haiku wanted to exist. So that's what I did instead.

After dinner, I worked on my first piece of art for my new tablet. The Note Air 4 C, that is. I made a tree. I haven't looked at it on or regular screen yet. But I like how it turned out on the color e-ink screen. I'm not yet a fan of the native app. It's designed for note taking and not artwork. I already knew that. But I watched videos of people using the note app for artwork and liked what I saw. I need to give it some practice and find my flow. I may also try some third-party art apps. But I've heard they can be laggy.

I'm watching the Cubs game tonight. I hope they win and advance to play against the Dodgers. Both are my favorite teams of the league. It would be fun to watch them face off in the NLCS. Based on how they have been playing tonight, I have my doubts they'll win...LOL The game isn't likely going to be done by the time I post this...LOL

On my walk, I decided I will be taking a sabbatical from Sunday church for a little while. I'm not yet sure how long. I've been thinking and praying about it for a while. As I was praying on my walk, I felt like I should try it for a bit. There's a reason my spirit feels this way. I can't ignore it any longer. I need to see what God's Will is. So I'll use this time away to seek the Lord. I've been looking for some missing LEGO pieces in a store that looked good...but I should be waiting for God to give me the next pieces as I sit at my little table...*wink, wink*

Well, I'm happy to say that I still feel really good this evening. Today was a good day <3

## NLCS

Well, the game ended before I published this. The Cubs lost. So the Brewers are going to face off with the Dodgers. I guess the first game will be in Milwaukee. GO DODGERS!!!

## Haiku

A change in the breeze\
The water's edge is peaceful\
Today's end has come
