# Tortoise vs. Hare

## 9:15am

It's Humpty Dumpty Day once more! Yay! I love writing his tales every Wednesday. Today's will be about him dancing in the rain...hehehe

I'm listening to music this morning. This time it's because of the lawn maintenance noise outside. I love my new studio headphones. And I love using my Palma 2 as a music player. It definitely gives me that iPod feel. I wish they'd make those again. We've lost *something* by making devices that *do it all*. At least for me. Oh well...LOL

I painted a digital work last night. I named it "Distracted" as inspired by what I wrote yesterday on the subject. I posted it on Instagram. This morning I started writing what I'll be saying about it when I post it on my website.

Time for coffee and toast...

I just got out of the team meeting we have every week. I was given an *assignment* I don't really want to do. I don't often talk about what I don't like...LOL But these things do happen. I'm highly unmotivated to do the task. But that's mostly because I don't see the point in it yet. Perhaps I'll find the point along the way...hehehe

I'm going to write Humpty's tale now. That will help me get past this...*sigh*...LOL j/k hahaha

## 11:00am

I love how Humpty's tale turned out this week. Normally he faces tragedy. This week he faced triumph. If this becomes a project someday, I feel it will be heavy on misfortune. But I do love to give him good fortune from time to time. Sometimes his tale should be fair, and not always despair...hehehe

The AI image was sweet. The video was weird...LOL I love them both...LOL

While getting my Wednesday sushi, a bird decided my car made for a good toilet...LOL So I went to the car wash. I know it happened at the grocery because it would have been something I would have noticed when I got in my car before going. It was right on the windshield on the drive's side...LOL I enjoy the car wash. So I was glad for an excuse to go.

They didn't have exactly what I was hoping for with the sushi. But I was still able to get one of the premium rolls and 3 of the $5 rolls. I may decide to just start ordering sushi on Wednesdays instead of doing this. But at the same time, I can see the value of mystery.

This week's Bible study is hitting a bit differently than I expected. This entire book has actually. I mean this in a good way. I like when such a study isn't what I expect. The oddest part, though, is I'm not finding these lessons aligning with the episodes or the passages in John 12 that start each lesson. Perhaps I'm missing the connection. Regardless, I'm connecting with the lessons themselves, personally.

I'm considering a deep dive into the Gospels. Since I dropped the Bible in a Year plan and I'm taking a break from Sunday church, I'd like to do something else besides my weekly study with Cherie.

I'm not finished with my Supernote Bible project yet. But I did decide to transfer the individual books to the devices for the time being. It's nice to have those now for reference. The final version should come in handy for deeper study.

I'm not looking at Bible study as an intellectual exercise or discipline. I'm approaching it has a means to get to know God. I'm looking forward to knowing Him better. Bible study is just one way to do that out of the many other ways He reveals Himself to me.

Yesterday, I ordered a stand and a *paper feel* film for the Tab X C. The stand was to make it better when using it as a *desktop* with the Qwerkywriter keyboard. The notch in the back of the keyboard didn't provide enough stability for my comfort for the size of this tablet. It's a really big device at 13+ inches. The film was to improve on its ability to be a drawing tablet. The film seems to fit the bill nicely. I tried a quick test and loved the *feel*. I'll try the stand later when I post this.

My conversation with Cherie about Apple products reminded me of a funny story from years ago. This was around 2010 or 11. I was having lunch with a co-worker and our boss at a dive in Indy. There was a lot of Android vs. iPhone *talk* back in those days. Our boss had wondered about something that could be looked up on a maps app. So he challenged us to a race to look it up to see which phone could do it quickest. My co-worker had the iPhone and I had Android. My co-corker jumped right on the search. I didn't even lift my phone. Our boss looked at me and asked why I wasn't looking it up. With the utmost confidence, I said, "I'm giving him a head start." Our boss burst out laughing and my co-worker rolled his eyes. I then lifted my phone and casually began the same search. I completed the task first and handed my phone to our boss. It was like we were playing out an Android commercial on TV...LOL After my boss and I were done laughing, and my co-worker's jaw was lifted from the floor, we began discussing why I was able to do it so quickly. Any number of factors could have played a role. Android vs. iPhone. AT&T vs. Verizon. Google Maps vs. Apple Maps. My best guess, though, it was tortoise vs. hare. He was rushing and I calmly did each step...hehehe He fumbled around while I had no issue pulling everything up on the phone...LOL

Looking back on that *funny* story, I'd have to admit that part of my hesitation to jump right in on the *race* is I sometimes avoid competition. I do love a health competition and a rivalry. It's fun! But I've had times in my life when I took *competition* too seriously. So I sometimes try to avoid it if I think my pride might take over. Honestly, that was one such moment. I was outspoken about Android being better than iPhone. Our boss knew that. Everyone knew that about me...LOL Deep down, I didn't want to race. I thought I'd win and it would just be an ego trip. But seeing as I didn't really care and it was becoming funny, I jumped in. *Winning* the *race* just made it funnier and a good story to tell now. My ego didn't even show up that day. My inner *Chandler Bing* showed up instead...HAHAHA

Mom's first round of chemo went well. She sounded fantastic tonight. I'll still be praying for this round because there could still be after effects in the days to come. But it was encouraging to hear the process went well and she's feeling good <3

The new stand works okay. It's more stable. But it still wobbles a little as I type. I may need to shop for a laptop stand to hold it instead of a tablet stand. When I say this thing is big, I mean huge! The screen is about the size of my MacBook screen...LOL

The dinner sushi wasn't a pleasant experience.
