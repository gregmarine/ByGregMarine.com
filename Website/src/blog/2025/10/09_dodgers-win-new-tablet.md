# Dodgers Win, New Tablet

## 8:30am

I appreciate *The Pour Over* and all of its related content. It has been a huge help as I have processed the news this year. I took a break from the news briefly late last year. As this year began, I looked for healthier ways to consume the news. I saw an ad for TPO on Instagram and checked it out. I also found out Cherie was subscribed as well. I appreciate how they frame the stories, tie in scripture and prayer, and the *whipped cream on top* is usually fun...LOL Today's was a video of penguins <3 My favorite animal <3

I responded to a Reddit post yesterday and the brief conversation got me thinking about how much my thinking process has evolved these past few years. And how it has taken a leap ever since I switched to using e-ink for writing. Especially the Supernote devices. Not only do I hand write most things now, I also use many of the organizational features specific to Supernote. This has allowed me to better organize my seemingly random thoughts and cross reference things. This has improved my ability to process thoughts as they happen. And not just when I write. Also when I'm simply thinking in everyday moments <3

I have yet to bring in the personal decor I boxed up at the beginning of the year. I have things around that I didn't box up. But I miss a lot of the things I put in storage. I hope to bring some of that back soon. Perhaps I should come up with seasonal things? I think I've talked about that before. I think it's good for me to miss things sometimes. Cycling through what I have around my little world would be good for me. That's what I love about my LEGO bonsai. It has a cycle.

## 12:15pm

I often use the wrong words...LOL I didn't mean *decor* when I was talking about all that I packed into storage at the beginning of the year. I meant the playful personal items I once put on my *old* TV stand and other places around my apartment. I haven't done much as far as actual decor is concerned since I first moved here. Since this place was meant to be temporary, I haven't invested much in decor. But on that subject, I think I can still do that with apartment living and do seasonal things. I can keep it simple and make it work regardless of where I live <3

## 2:30pm

That Reddit thread has become a full conversation now. It reminds me of the days when a lot of my intactions on social media were conversational. I see a lot of echo chambers these days with people yelling into the *void*. So it's nice to have real conversation with that post. In this case, it's paragraphs of replies...LOL It isn't just quick replies. The OP is now posting some of their artwork in the replies. It inspired me to pull out and look at a few pieces I've made. If they inquire, I'll post a few of my works. The conversation is about using a Supernote Nomad for writing, research, and art <3

I just discovered National Taco Day was this past Saturday! And I didn't get any tacos! I had the opportunity and chose a miso salmon bowl instead...LOL My dad had tacos...LOL So, I sat next to someone eating tacos on National Taco Day...LOL I had tacos the day before...LOL I almost got the chicken tacos that day. I should have listened to my heart instead of whatever crazy part of me wanted that miso salmon bowl...LOL No wait...it was this past Tuesday! I didn't have tacos that day either! And I call myself a taco lover?! Actually, I don't call myself that...LOL I go by Trex...LOL Trex loves tacos!

## 4:00pm

So, I did some research as to why I saw 2 different dates. And found a third date. National Taco Day was originally May 3rd in Texas. That eventually died off. Then the idea was resurrected to Oct 4ᵗʰ. Thanks to the *Internet*, it grew into the first Tuesday of October. I'll just celebrate tacos everytime I have them...LOL TACOS!

## 5:15pm

I'm having another one of those days where people are telling me that I'm an important part of there lives. And more things at work where I was able to help others resolve their issues. I'm grateful for everyone. And I'm grateful God has shown me how to see and hear these things. I'm looking and I'm listening. Thank You <3

LET'S GO DODGERS!!! DAAAAY-0! LOL

## 6:40pm

My Boox Tab X C arrived and I've begun its setup. I'll be using it tonight for those final steps to publish this entry. I can already see how the screen size will be helpful. It's about the same size screen as my MacBook Pro. I haven't yet worked with these Botox devices to do artwork. I hope to start exploring that...soon...LOL I'm working on a sketch on my Nomad today. I may export it and load it on one of these new color devices to do some *stained glass* work on that sketch.

## 9:10pm

Well, I spent nearly 3 hours trying to add my Google account to the new device. I kept running into a verification issue. I factory reset a few times. I did all of the troubleshooting I generally do. I had already updated to the latest firmware. I employed AI to no avail. And I did some Reddit searches. That final Reddit search brought me to my *aha* moment...LOL I had forgotten to set a pass code for the device. My Google account is a Business account...LOL I have been a Business customer with Google for a while. I forgot they have that requirement for this type of account.

The game is in the 11th...

## 9:50pm

The Dodgers are Division Series Champs once again! WOOHOO! I'm excited to continue cheering them on as the post-season continues for them.

I'm going to try finishing setting up the Tab X C for being able to post this entry...LOL I *lost* those 3 hours earlier. But that's okay. As frustrating as it was, I kept my cool and calmly worked the problem until the solution suddenly appeared like the sunshine in a clearing of the forest...hehehe

## 10:15pm

I'm all set to give the Tab X C a try for it's first use case. I have it setup to post this entry. So now I'm going to export the handwritten notes to text to revise on my Manta like usual. Then I'll load the text on the new device to post. Yay! LOL
