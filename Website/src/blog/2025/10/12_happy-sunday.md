# Happy Sunday

## 9:30am

I slept *okay* last night. But not *great*. I'm feeling a little anxious this morning. I journaled a prayer about my church sabbatical. The last time I did this, I was away about 6 years...LOL So I have some fears. But things are different this time. I'm not angry at the church, for one. And I'm considering time frames. I honestly don't know how long this will take. God's timing is perfect. But I'll reevaluate this as time passes. One thought is until the end of October. We'll see...

I'm going to have breakfast and do more of the Bible study. I'm not finished yet.

## 10:25am

Breakfast is over...hehehe I'm feeling *shalom* once again. Perhaps it's because the service I usually attend is over now?..LOL Nah...it's because I'm drawing nearer to God through this. And that's the point, isn't it? Rest, reset, and regroup. Recenter on the One Who is sovereign over everything; including my troubled heart.

## 10:45am

I keep making the silliest mistakes this morning. Like how I splashed a bunch of water all over the place while washing my dishes a moment ago. These things used to pile up in my mind and do a number on me, mentally. It doesn't anymore. Now, I'm like Olaf in the scene with the ice circle..."Oh look! I've been impaled..." *giggle*

## 12:45pm

I'm all finished with this weeks Bible study lesson. I'm glad I did things differently this week considering what this week means to me. The lesson made an impact on the week. And the week made an impact on the lesson. I'm grateful for both.

This was the first time I used the Tab X C to go from the text file I create on the Manta to the Google Doc I generate the PDF from. I still used the Manta as the word processor because this was a transitional week with the new e-ink tablets. I may use the Tab X C as the word processor for the Bible study lesson next week.

I may do the same tonight for this journal entry. The point of using the Manta as a word processor was the e-ink screen. The Tab X C is e-ink and the device I use to post to my website anyway. Once I export the handwritten entry to text, I can just revise on the Tab X C now. Pretty neat if you ask me...LOL

Now I need to think about lunch... hehehe

## 3:40pm

I ended up going to Culver's for lunch. Dan influenced my choice of meal when he mentioned fish and chips yesterday...LOL So that's what I had for lunch today...hehehe After I had my meal, I ordered a sundae and had a *Cherie* (cherry) put on top this time...LOL

I was on my way home and decided I'd go see the ocean instead. It's a beautiful day and I love the water. It was a nice time of reflection. Although I had my Nomad with me, I didn't write anything.

A community church service started up just after I arrived. It was nice to be in worship for a moment. I couldn't hear the message from where I sat. But I was inspired by something and put that in my prayer journal for today in the form of a question. It's related to this sabbatical I started today.

## 8:30pm

I wasn't going to eat dinner after our call. But I changed my mind. I'm having a full meal after all. And I'm skipping my evening coffee. I'm going to watch this coming week's episode (S5E4) of *The Chosen* tonight as well. I saw that the episode 1 roundtable discussion has finally posted. So I'll be watching that this week sometime. And I'll watch the episode 4 aftershow for this week's episode this week as well. I'm not yet sure how I'll organize my Bible study time this week. I've done it a little differently each time for this book...LOL

## 9:50pm

I'm glad I watched the episode. I had forgotten how much I love this one. I'll likely watch it a few more times this week...hehehe I needed to see it tonight.

This was good day. I loved today <3

## 10:15pm

I used that Tab X C for the final revision of this post after I exported the handwritten version on the Manta. This will make the workflow even better. I'm typing this timestamp on the Tab X C too. I've paired my Qwerkywriter mechanical keyboard with it. I'm really enjoying how this feels and I'm glad I gave it a try tonight.
