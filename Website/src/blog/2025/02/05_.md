Something in the Bible study triggered a fond memory from my childhood. Way back before I was able to talk, I would take toys apart all the time. I was curious how they worked and what they were made of. Unfortunately, these toys were not meant to be disassembled...LOL And some of those toys were my older brothers...HAHAHA

This gave me the reputation of being a destructive child. I remember it well, though. I definitely was just curious. And I was sad that I had broken so many things that I couldn't put back together...hehehe My parents recognized my curiosity. They hunted down a special toy that was designed to be taken apart and put back together. It was a truck that had pieces that screwed together in various places. I was able to disassemble and reassemble it at will. It helped develop my curious mind without destroying the toy in the process.

After I received that toy, I stopped taking apart other toys...hehehe As I grew up, I became known as a tinkerer. I would build things out of just about anything. And when something broke, I found new uses for the broken things. Nothing is truly broken until I throw it away. Sometimes, a broken thing gives birth to two new things. Or it simply changes into something new by itself.

I'm grateful for that little truck. I wish I still had it...LOL It changed my life.

In the latter years of childhood, my brother would have me put together his models. For awhile, our parents thought he was putting them together. He never claimed to. They just assumed. Sometime later, they came to find out I was the one putting them together...LOL I didn't want the attention. I just loved putting things together. And my brother just loved the result of having a model...hehehe
