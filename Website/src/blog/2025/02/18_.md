## My Day

### 09:00am

I've been a bit disconnected from my journal lately. So, I decided I would give a timestamp entry a go again. When I get a little *off*, timestamp entries tend to bring me back. I don't really have a goal to write everyday. But lately, I have had a lot I want to write. My days have just been full and I'm too tired at the end of the day to write much...hehehe

I've tried to use the Journal app on my phone. But it isn't natural for me. I do use it. I just don't write everything that is actually on my mind because writing on a phone is difficult for me. They don't have an option to use the Mac or iPad. I can connect to my phone through my Mac now. But even that is clunky...LOL I should just find another journal app or use the Notes app like I've done before.
