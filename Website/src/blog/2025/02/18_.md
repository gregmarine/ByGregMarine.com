## My Day

### 09:00am

I've been a bit disconnected from my journal lately. So, I decided I would give a timestamp entry a go again. When I get a little *off*, timestamp entries tend to bring me back. I don't really have a goal to write everyday. But lately, I have had a lot I want to write.

I've tried to use the Journal app on my phone. But it isn't natural for me. I do use it. I just don't write everything that is actually on my mind because writing on a phone is difficult for me. The app doesn't have an option to use the Mac or iPad. I can connect to my phone through my Mac now. But even that is clunky...LOL I should just find another journal app or use the Notes app like I've done before.

### 10:30am

I got a late start to my coffee and breakfast today...hehehe I did that yesterday too. A new trend? LOL j/k But speaking of coffee, last night I was reading in my journal entry from a year ago yesterday that the first time I enjoyed Joffrey's Sumatra origins coffee was February 17 last year. I mentioned back then that I loved it and would likely get it again. I've gotten it with every order since...LOL This morning, I'm drinking the last of my current supply. I ordered more last week and hope to get it by the end of this week...hehehe

I finally recorded *Do You Wanna Be Like Budford?* LOL Originally, I wrote it to be Do You Wanna Be *WITH* Budford... But I like what I landed on instead...hehehe This one took me longer than any other song I've made with his voice. This one is special because it is a cross over to my favorite Disney character...hehehe Olaf isn't actually in the original Disney song. But the song is inspired by the little *Olaf* Elsa made for Anna when they were kids. Later, we find out Anna made little *Olaf*s for Elsa throughout the years...hehehe

Anyway, I wanted this song to be special. I really love how it turned out. The lyrics and the personality I brought to the song really expresses the warm hug I wanted it to be ðŸ¤—
