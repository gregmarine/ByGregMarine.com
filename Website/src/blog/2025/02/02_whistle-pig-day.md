# Whistle Pig Day

## My Day

Well, the whistle pig saw his shadow today...LOL One of the names groundhogs go by is whistle pig. I like that name better than *groundhog*...LOL [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day) has quite the history. I found out this year that it has it's origins in Germany. At least based on the Wikipedia article...LOL

I think I'd like to go see the ceremony someday. It isn't a bucket list item. But it does seem like something I would enjoy. It's weird and unique...hehehe

I've said this at least a few times...LOL I love Sundays. They are a blessing. I spend most of the day focused on my relationship with God. The day has evolved quite a bit over the last year. It has become a great way to start off my week.

Today was a little different. The CUMC live feed wasn't working at 11. So I watched the previously recorded traditional service from earlier this morning. I absolutely loved it! I hadn't ever watched their traditional service before. I did tune in to the live traditional Christmas Eve service. But that was a holiday service. Today's was a normal weekend service. If I were attending physically, that's the service I'd be going to!

On the one walk I was able to get in today, I saw the bald eagle again! That is such a beautiful bird. I wish I would have had my regular mirror-less camera so I could have zoomed in on it...hehehe I captured some videos of it. But the iPhone camera doesn't do this beautiful creature justice. I'm glad I was able to enjoy it with my own eyes, though.

When I see a reoccurring theme in my Bible studies, the messages from church, and sometimes random sources like social media, I believe it's clear that the message is something important and I should be paying attention. The current reoccurring theme? John 13:35 - *"By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another."* Is God trying to tell me something? It came up throughout the week in the Bible study and was in today's sermon. And I saw something on social media from a friend of mine. I'm paying attention...hehehe

My grandmother's 90th birthday is coming up in 4 weeks. One of my cousins had the idea of us grand kids getting her a digital photo frame that allows us to send photos and they *magically* start showing up on the frame...hehehe I hadn't heard of those before. I had only seen the ones where you have to transfer photos from a computer. I love this idea! We all chipped in to get it. It will be fun to send photos to the frame and for her to discover the photos as they randomly start showing up...hehehe

I used Zelle for the first time to send my portion of the money...LOL I've used other forms of money transfer hundreds of times. I've had Zelle with my bank for years. I've just never actually used it. It was super easy and I think I like it better...hehehe I know Zelle is still a third party. But they work directly with my bank instead of through some other means. So I think I like that better.

I don't think I'll be doing this with my 2 upcoming projects, but I'm going to start experimenting with a new style for paintings. I came up with the idea a few years ago. I call it *a work in progress* where different parts of the painting are in difference stages of the process. It will look like an unfinished creation. But that's the point...LOL I'm also thinking about doing these on paper instead of canvas. It's something I'd like to try sometime this year, I think. Just a thought for now, though...LOL

Being at the art festival reignites my passion for creating. Hopefully I truly tap into that this year. It's on my list of goals this time. We shall see! HAHAHA

Something this year's festival sparked is I think I'd like to try to see some of the Disney on Broadway shows. *The Lion King* is going to be in Tampa in April. I'm thinking about going to see it. It will be a first for me...hehehe Seeing a broadway show live, that is. It won't be *On Broadway* since it will be in Tampa...LOL But it's the same show and it will be in a theatre...hehehe

## Wrapping Up

Although I'm doing a featured photo each day this year, I don't feel as though I need to do a blog post everyday. But so far, I have done one everyday...LOL

Today's feels like I was just rambling...HAHAHA But I did have things on my mind. So, I wrote. I feel like I had more on my mind earlier. I didn't get around to writing until late, though. So, some of what was on my mind earlier is lost FOREVER...EVER...EVEr...EVer...Ever...ever...eve...ev...e...

I'm looking forward to this week. There isn't anything *special* going on. But each day is special to me now...
