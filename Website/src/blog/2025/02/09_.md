# TBD

I didn't go to theChapel this morning. Instead, I spent some time with God by myself at home. I had my usual breakfast. I did the *Bible in a Year* reading and recap. Then I went over my Bible study notes and added more to it. By the time I was done with all of that, it was time for CUMC's service. Although I didn't go to theChapel, I did tune into CUMC...hehehe

The morning felt very blessed. After all of that, I prepared some chicken for my lunch and began its marinading in the fridge. I then went on my first walk of the day. Today was a very pleasant day to be outside. I took two walks total.

I felt a deeper connection with this season's *The Chosen* Bible study. I honestly don't know that my notes reflected how deep it was for me. But the fellowship had discussions that I think my deer friend could sense the deep connection...even if my notes didn't always reflect it. I *hope* that my *life* reflects it, though. I'm learning so much about God through this process. And I want to respond to this new knowledge.
