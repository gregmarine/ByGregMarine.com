# May My Life Reflect the Blessings

I didn't go to theChapel this morning. Instead, I spent some time with God by myself at home. I had my usual breakfast. I did the *Bible in a Year* reading and recap. Then I went over my Bible study notes and added more to it. By the time I was done with all of that, it was time for CUMC's service. Although I didn't go to theChapel, I did tune into CUMC...hehehe

The morning felt very blessed. After all of that, I prepared some chicken for my lunch and began its marinading in the fridge. I then went on my first walk of the day. Today was a very pleasant day to be outside. I took two walks total.

I felt a deeper connection with this season's *The Chosen* Bible study. I honestly don't know that my notes reflected how deep it was for me. But the fellowship had discussions that I think my deer friend could sense the deep connection...even if my notes didn't always reflect it. I *hope* that my *life* reflects it, though. I'm learning so much about God through this process. And I want to respond to this new knowledge.

I *finished* a painting today...hehehe I'm waiting overnight for it to completely dry before I declare it officially finished. That's when I'll officially name, date, and sign it. Then it will actually be finished...hehehe This one is probably my favorite I've done. Not because of the subject or even who it was made for. There's something special about this particular piece. When I look at it, I have peace in my mind, soul, and heart <3 I hope it brings the same peace of spirit to my deer friend <3

I hope to begin my next piece this week. I did the digital concept for it last year...LOL I didn't get around to painting on canvas yet.

I need to buy new canvases. After this next piece, I'll be out of my 4x4 inch canvases...LOL Well, I do have some other ones. But I don't like how the colors turn out on them. The brand I've had for my most recent work has been so much better than some of my other ones. I switched because I didn't like some of the other brands. I've discovered not all canvases are created equal...LOL

I'm also hoping to get back to creative writing this week. I have a few projects in progress that I'd love to make some progress on this week.

My creative juices have been flowing lately. I'm very happy about that. For years, all of this had stopped...LOL They started up again at the end of 2021. But it has been rough getting back into a groove. It is one of my goals this year to get a healthy cadence going again. I haven't been this creative since the 90s and early 2000s...LOL We shall see what comes of this throughout the year. But I'm off to a pretty good start I think.

I realized today that I have featured 40 photos so far this year. And I've journaled on this blog for 40 days. More than that if you include those last few days of 2024. But so far, I've been consistent for the year. I hadn't planned to journal everyday. But the photos being a daily thing was a goal. I suppose having a featured photo helps inspire me to journal as well.

Today was fellowship day...hehehe I love that we do this most Sundays. I miss it when we don't. I'm the reason we missed it a few times last year...hehehe Traveling makes it hard some weekends. I always feel guilty when I'm not available due to travel. This fellowship has been a blessing. I imagine it has been for her as well. She says as much <3 But we never truly know the impact these things have on each other. Sometimes, words cannot express what the blessings truly mean. As I said above, I can only hope that my life reflects it.

## Wrapping Up

I'm sort of in a weird place right now. My heart is very happy and my year is starting off really well. But I also feel that some of the people I love are having a difficult year so far. I also see that many other people I know are having a rough go of it. I don't feel the weight of their struggles. But I'm able to pray for them. And I hope the strength God has given me will help them through their struggles. I pray for His strength to be with them too. But sometimes God places me in the lives of others to help be that strength. Sometimes it takes someone from the outside to help show where to find God in the struggle. I know I've needed that in my own life. And I'm grateful when God uses other people for me. I'm equally grateful when God uses me for them.

I'm glad I went through my struggles. And I'll happily go through future struggles. These things help me remain empathetic for the struggles others go through. I find Blessings in all of this. No, I haven't always felt this way...LOL These past few years have been heart transforming. Jesus went through struggles. He knows. He's where I find the Blessings. May my life reflect the Blessings <3
