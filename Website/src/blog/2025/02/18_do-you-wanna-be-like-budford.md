# Do You Wanna Be Like Budford?

## My Day

### 09:00am

I've been a bit disconnected from my journal lately. So, I decided I would give a timestamp entry a go again. When I get a little *off*, timestamp entries tend to bring me back. I don't really have a goal to write everyday. But lately, I have had a lot I want to write.

I've tried to use the Journal app on my phone. But it isn't natural for me. I do use it. I just don't write everything that is actually on my mind because writing on a phone is difficult for me. The app doesn't have an option to use the Mac or iPad. I can connect to my phone through my Mac now. But even that is clunky...LOL I should just find another journal app or use the Notes app like I've done before.

### 10:30am

I got a late start to my coffee and breakfast today...hehehe I did that yesterday too. A new trend? LOL j/k But speaking of coffee, last night I was reading in my journal entry from a year ago yesterday that the first time I enjoyed [Joffrey's Sumatra origins coffee](https://joffreys.com/collections/origin/products/sumatra?variant=45198061109525) was February 17 last year. I mentioned back then that I loved it and would likely get it again. I've gotten it with every order since...LOL This morning, I'm drinking the last of my current supply. I ordered more last week and hope to get it by the end of this week...hehehe

I finally recorded *Do You Wanna Be Like Budford?* LOL Originally, I wrote it to be Do You Wanna Be *WITH* Budford... But I like what I landed on instead...hehehe This one took me longer than any other song I've made with his voice. This one is special because it is a cross over to my favorite Disney character...hehehe Olaf isn't actually in the original Disney song. But the song is inspired by the little *Olaf* Elsa made for Anna when they were kids. Later, we find out Anna made little *Olaf*s for Elsa throughout the years...hehehe

Anyway, I wanted this song to be special. I really love how it turned out. The lyrics and the personality I brought to the song really expresses the warm hug I wanted it to be ðŸ¤—

### 03:30pm

I was finally able to get outside for a short walk. It has been a busy day at work. Even on busy days, I like to break away for a little bit. It just hasn't worked out today...hehehe

It's a beautiful day today. A great temperature and the sun is shining. It's a little windy. But not too bad. The smell isn't great, though...LOL They are resealing the parking lots this week and next. So there is a tar smell right now. It's suppose to rain tomorrow. They pushed back the process another day as a result. I was suppose to move my car tomorrow night to prepare for my area to get sealed on Thursday. Now the plan is to move my car Thursday for a seal treatment Friday.

I'm working a half day on Friday. I'll then be going to Disney World to meet up with some friends. One of them is visiting from out of town. Friday was my best day to see them. I took a half day from work so I could get over there and see them in the afternoon into the evening.

I'm planning to dress dapper for this visit. I'll be wearing greens and browns. I'm thinking about wearing my Figment artist pin. It doesn't really match the outfit. But it does match the festival going on at EPCOT. As my collection grows, I'll have better matching pins for all occasions...hehehe Wearing a pin, if even mismatched, it a goal of mine.

They suddenly switched which magnet is available for Annual Passholders. They were doing a *Ray* one for *Princess and the Frog*. Now they are doing a *Minnie Mouse* magnet. So I'll finally get a Minnie to go with my Mickey one...hehehe I'm really excited about that! They used to give the Minnie one out when you got a new pass or renewed. But I never got one. They always send the Mickey one. I feel like my collection of magnets will be complete now...LOL

### 05:30pm

I just got in from an evening walk. I encountered a lot of people tonight. It was a little unusual. I'm glad to see so many others enjoying this nice weather today.

I don't normally do it on this day, or at this time, or for any particular reason...hehehe But I stopped by my mailbox to grab my mail. It had been a while. I don't have a routine for it because all of the important stuff arrives electronically these days. I was surprised to see the mail carrier was still here at this hour. They are normally finished in the afternoon. It was the regular guy I've seen and interacted with several times.

Today, he seemed a bit down. I started to walk back to my apartment. But it weighed a bit on my heart that he wasn't his normal chipper self. So I went back to check up on him. He said he was fine but that it had just been one of *those* days...hehehe He mentioned there was a lot more mail than usual. By the time we were done chatting, he was back to his normal chipper self that I had come to know. Sometimes, what we need is a little chat...hehehe

I jokingly said that I would offer to help him finish delivering the mail but said I assumed there were laws against me helping...HAHAHA We both chuckled and I wished him a good evening...hehehe

It's time to make tacos now. I'm going with tofu tacos this week. I'll be making my taco seasoning. The tofu will be all crumbled up as if it was ground meat...hehehe I love celebrating taco Tuesdays...LOL

### 08:10pm

Whoa! This week's Bible study ðŸ˜± Last week, we just did the intro. It wasn't as deep as the previous two books' introductions. But lesson one is amazing! I read through the whole thing last night after watching the episode. I knew right away this week was going to be amazing ðŸ¤©

After watching the episode again tonight, I did my first session of working through the lesson and making notes to discuss in our fellowship on Sunday. I'm really excited about this lesson and it is only just beginning!

By the way, the tacos were pretty good. They weren't as amazing as the Bible study lesson. And they weren't my best tacos. But I still enjoyed them...hehehe I think they needed some salsa or pico de gallo. Either of those would have gone well with the sauerkraut.

I've been getting some different tortillas lately. They only have 4 ingredients and are organic. I could probably start making my own. And I may someday. But for now, these new(to me) ones will do nicely.

Time to pick my photo for today. I've been doing this technique where I record a video and take a screenshot to create the photo. So far, that's what I've done for all by one of the photos I've featured this year. I'm thinking about doing some regular still images. I sometimes miss the regular way to snap a photo...hehehe

I'm also going to make my evening coffee and treat.

### 09:30pm

Well, today's photo ended up being sourced from a still image instead of a video...LOL I went with a photo of my tacos for tonight...hehehe I did both a video and a regular still. But I went with the still instead of using a screenshot from the video.

I don't make tacos every week. But when I do, I love celebrating tacos on Tuesdays <3

### 10:00pm

I love coffee. I drink it all the time. But prior to 2019, I didn't care for it. When my grandfather passed away in May of 2019, I took it up in his memory. Now I'm well known for enjoying that bitter black nectar...LOL Especially Joffrey's. When I visit my parents, my dad brews extra coffee and leaves it on the maker to keep it warm for when I am ready to partake. He doesn't use Joffrey's. But his coffee is *good enough*...LOL

Do you remember when it was the end of the broadcast day and they would have the flag on TV with the Star Spangled Banner playing? I sometimes miss things like that. Regular TV is 24/7 now. And streaming is on-demand whenever you want it. But TV used to be like the seasons. There was a beginning and an end.

And with that, here is the end of today's entry <3
