## My Day

Today was quite a day! I had a very productive day at work. It was full of meetings. But most of them were working meetings to go through fixing things or working with the business side of things. I love days like today with all of the productivity...hehehe It also helped the day go by more quickly.

I was able to get in 3 short walks today. I had several options for today's photo...hehehe You'll see the chosen one below, of course. It was a very pleasant day to be out for walks.

I don't think I mentioned it yesterday, but I did a meatless Monday...LOL I hadn't really planned it ahead of time. But it ended up happening. I think I also went all plant-based. I didn't even use ghee for anything yesterday...LOL I'm not sure I've ever done a fully plant-based day before. It wasn't really intentional, though. I used coconut oil for my chowmein. And the protein was tofu. And I'm pretty sure all of the snacks I had are plant-based. Again, not that it was my goal. It just happened to work out...LOL

I loved how the chowmein turned out. I hope I can repeat it because it is the closest I've been able to get to what real chowmein is at a restaurant...hehehe I thought about trying it again later this week. But I already miss my fried rice...LOL So, I'll be going back to rice tomorrow, I think. I can do the chowmein again on Monday. Monday's are typically when I do noodles now...hehehe

I made tuna tacos tonight. And they were delicious! I don't think I've ever prepared tuna before. It was pretty simple. I marinated it in coco aminos. I then baked it. I cut it up to put it on the tacos.

I had a really creative day. I made a pair of funny videos for my deer friend. They were based on a video I made for her yesterday. But then I made the two today based on our conversations about the *character* I played in the videos. I'm basically an annoyed T-Rex. He's annoyed because he has such short arms...LOL But he discovered a new super power today. His right arm grows! HAHAHA This tenacious t-rex took my tuna tacos!!! HAHAHA

After I was done with my Bible study session for tonight, I worked on my next painting. I did all of the digital art concept for the project. And then I sketched it out on a 4x4 inch canvas. It is all set for painting over the next few days. It's going to be a really sweet painting. It will probably be one of my favorites once it is finished...hehehe

After that, I did some creative writing on one of my new projects. I started it last week I think. But I had some new ideas that I wanted to try. So, I made a copy of what I already had and reworked a bunch of it. I also added some stuff. It's a little zany. It has been fun to work on and I look forward to where it is going.

Aside from all of these creative works, I also did the featured photo below. Yeah, a very creative day, indeed! All of this on top of my usual workday, Bible study, and general routines. And now I'm writing in my journal again...LOL I really love days like today. They don't happen too often. But I'm grateful when they do happen.

I reevaluated my weight loss today. Having lost a measurable amount to start the year, I wanted to double check the weight calculator...hehehe I figured I might be at my ideal weight for my age and body. Yep, I'm right in the sweet spot. I really should avoid losing any more. I've already started eating more because of my increased activity. I'm going to continue monitoring to be sure I'm not losing any more than I have already. I'm not concerned or anything. I was just surprised it happened...LOL I feel really good. I have lots of energy. I'm sleeping well. I'm getting a lot accomplished through a very active brain. It seems my health is doing really well right now.

## Wrapping Up

It's short notice, but I need to plan a quick trip up to Indiana. My parents and aunts and uncles decided to throw my grandmother a 90th birthday party. I kind of figured they would. So I should have tried to plan a trip already. But I didn't actually know when they might do it. I was told the official date for it today...LOL I need to decide quickly so I can book the planes. It's only a few weeks away...LOL

Today was a really good day. I love today <3
