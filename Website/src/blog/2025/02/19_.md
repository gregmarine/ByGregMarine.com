# TBD

For a while now, I've been asking myself and others, *what was your favorite moment today?* I also ask things like *what was something that made you laugh/smile/happy?* I recently added a new one. *What was the worst thing that happened to you today?* Although I ask myself this one, I ask very few others...hehehe That one is a little more personal. And I never expect anyone to answer such a question if they aren't comfortable doing so.

I got the idea for this question after reading a story about how a parent would ask their child how their day was. The child would typically say it was *good* and move on about their evening. One night, the child broke down into tears. The parents was concerned and asked what was bother them. As it turned out, the child's day was not actually good. Something had happened at school that day that upset the child.

After that happened, the parent started to ask what was the worst thing that happened to them each day. After that question was answered, the parent would then ask what was the best thing that happened. That way there is a good balance. This inspired me to find such a balance in my own life. As a generally positive person, I'm always on the lookout for my favorite moments. But I should also be paying attention to the worst ones. I cannot ignore those or their impact on my life.

As far asking that question of others, I'm picky about who I ask. I have to have a deep connection with them. They need to feel safe with me and I with them. But asking such a question sends a clear message that I care very deeply for them. I don't just want the best of who they are. I want all of who they are. Even the bad stuff. I want to know what is hurting them so I can pray for them. And by listening, perhaps it will help the healing process or help them learn from whatever the circumstance might be.

I was notified my coffee order is on its way...YAY...hehehe I mentioned yesterday that I brewed my last Sumatra beans. I still have some beans from another Joffrey's blend. So I my had coffee today...hehehe But the new batch of beans is due to arrive tomorrow, I believe. One of the bags, the Joffrey's 40th Anniversary blend, was free. I had earned enough *points* to get a free bag of beans...LOL Sometime last year, they switched systems and started offering *VIP* points to be earned over time through purchases...hehehe
