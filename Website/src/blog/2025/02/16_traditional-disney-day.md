# Traditional? Disney Day

It has been a few days...hahaha The last few entries were just the photos and Bible in a Year. And yesterday, I didn't post anything. So, today's includes the photo from yesterday and the one for today...hehehe

As you can see from yesterday's photo, I went to Disney World yesterday. I had a great time there. Before I went, I wanted to be sure I was done with this weekend's tasks. I did the Bible in a Year reading for yesterday, finished my notes on this week's introduction lesson for The Chosen Bible study, and I did this weekend's task for February's simplification goal. I achieved all of that before noon. So, I decided I would go to Disney World. Not as a reward or anything. Just because I felt like it...hehehe

As it turns out, I've gone to Disney on February 15th (yesterday) every year for the past 3 February 15ths...LOL It wasn't really planned that way. But it seems to be a tradition now...hehehe The 2023 reason was for a meetup. Last year was a mental health day with a bout with depression. This year, it was *just because*. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I keep going.

I'm glad I journaled about it last year. It is interesting to see how far I've come since that day. I was dealing with depression for a few days. I remember when I used to go weeks or months with depression. A year ago, it was a few days. If I recall, I dealt with it a few more times last year after that. But now it has been so long that I don't actually recall the last time I was truly depressed.

I've been doing really well for a while now. Yesterday's trip to Disney was because they are closing one of my favorite restaurants, Mama Melrose...LOL I did other things after eating there. But that was the reason I went...LOL What a big difference in motivation between last February 15th and yesterday...LOL

I arrived at Disney around 2:30pm. My reservation was for 2:55pm. So, plenty of time to get there and not be in a rush to get to where the restaurant is. I had plenty of time to use the restroom and start taking videos for yesterday's photo. The featured photo actually came from those early videos...hehehe

When I got back to the restaurant to check in, I told them I would happily sit at the pizza bar so I wouldn't be taking up a full table that would otherwise go to a sweet couple...hehehe That also meant they were able to sit me right away because there just happened to be a single seat available at the pizza bar...LOL

I went with their fish special, a mahi mahi dish. I also had their tiramis√∫. To drink, I went with Agave Garden, a mocktail with agave, lime, passionfruit, papaya, cucumber, and green tea. It was all very good. The ambience, food, service, and timing were all very good.

I went to see the Muppet 3D show after lunch. That's something else that is closing this year. I love that show and laugh at the same jokes every single time...hehehe

I planned to walk over to EPCOT, catch the monorail over to the TTC, and the ferry over to Magic Kingdom. I did the walking over to EPCOT part...LOL But when I got there, I decided to watch the Broadway Concert Series performance at 5:30pm...hehehe I'm so glad that I did. I really enjoyed that.

After that, I ate some of the festival food and then walked back over to Hollywood Studios. On my way back, I stopped off at The Cake Bake restaurant. My parents will be down in April and we wanted to go there for mom's birthday. But getting reservations has been very difficult. I asked about availability and there turns out to be plenty. The issue we've been having is that they only have 5% of the table reservations available through Disney...LOL They are a third party vendor and the other 95% of the reservations are through their own system...LOL So I was able to secure our reservation with no issue...LOL

After that, I went back to HS, got a treat that I had never tried before to eat on the way home, grabbed my typical coffee and headed home. I had a great time.

I hope to get back to my usual writing this week. I have other things on my mind than Disney and my photos...hehehe
