# Dodgers, Disney, and Dapper

I'm glad baseball season is back. It was so much fun getting back into that last year. I decided to go ahead and subscribe to MLB TV/Network this season. I wanted to be able to follow along with as many games as possible. I'll mention this again with Thursday's photo of the day below...hehehe

I went to Disney yesterday. I hung out with some friends. One of them is here from out of town. The others live near Disney. I don't see any of them very often anymore. Only a few of them I would consider friends, actually. The others are acquittances. But we all have those few friends in common...hehehe

I bounced back and forth on what I'd be wearing yesterday for my time at EPCOT. I thought about just blending in. I thought about doing my casual Olaf bound. I thought about doing a brown and green themed dapper. I settled on the brown and green dapper. I'm happier in the dapper...hehehe

I've already started looking into summer dapper ideas. I found that they make some really nice clothes that are designed for hot weather. They are a little pricier than most of the things I've been getting. So that collection might be something I slowly grow over the years. But I also got several retro shirts that will work well in the hot weather. Those weren't expensive. So, I'm going to have some fun this summer with my parks attire...hehehe

This has been so much fun to explore. I didn't like how I looked when I was overweight. Now that I'm at a healthy size, I love how I look. My clothes are starting to match how I feel. I used to struggle with all of this. Now, I'm not struggling. I'm so happy and I'm enjoying the styles and looks I've been working on. Honestly, I never thought I'd ever be a person who would care what clothes I'm wearing. But here I am, getting into fashion...LOL The best part? I'm matching the clothes to how I already feel. Yes, it all makes me happy. But I'm already happy. This is just an outward expression of how I'm feeling <3

I went to Zen today for lunch. I spent way too long there...LOL But I enjoyed talking with the Saturday bartender friend of mine. She mentioned today that it always throws her off when I'm not there...LOL Last year, I went all the time. This year, it's about once every 2 to 3 weeks...LOL After that, I did my weekly grocery shopping to stock up for the week. I think I have enough food to get me through until my vacation the first week of March at Disney and Indiana.

I didn't get to watch the game yesterday live because I was at Disney. But Thursday and today, I was able to watch Dodgers Spring training live. I went back and watched the replay of yesterday's after today's game. It has been nice to watch these games. They don't count for the season. But it's a first glimpse at this years team and potential new players. I imagine it is revealing what the team needs to work on going into the season. The season starts next month just before my birthday.

Last year, I journaled about how the Dodgers won the first Spring training game. I thought it would be great for them to win the World Series so they could also win the last games of the year...LOL Yep, they achieved that...HAHAHA I hope they don't do the opposite this year. They lost the first three games so far. I sure hope they don't lose the last game of the year...LOL I'd rather they still win that one because that would mean they'd be World Series Champions again...LOL

I received the notice for the lease renewal options at my apartment complex. It looks like they are happy to keep me here...LOL But not so happy to give me a good deal...HAHAHA They want to increase my rent more than I like. Honestly, at this point, any increase is something I don't like because the actual value has decreased since I've lived here...hehehe But the increase isn't unlike the market. If I moved, I'd be paying more anyway. I'm sure that's the reason for the increase...hehehe

That is part of apartment living, actually. In years past, at apartments in Indiana and Illinois, it seemed the increases weren't that much each year and they always offered some sort of perk for staying. Something like a fresh coat of paint or deep cleaning the carpets. I plan to stay. So, going into my forth year, they are increasing rent again (by a lot) and not offering a perk like new paint or deep cleaning...LOL

It's kind of funny how I was thinking not long ago that I was ready to move. I also wanted to move a year ago. But now, I've found peace with living here and I'm focusing on what I love about it. I'm also going through a simplification process to minimize what is in my living space. That process is going really well and my home is becoming more relaxing for me.
