# Bees a Buzzin and Where's My Wallet ðŸ¤£

## My Day

I didn't go to the grocery over the weekend like I normally do. I went to Disney with my sister on Saturday and Sundays no longer work because I don't go to the main campus for church anymore...hehehe So, I went tonight. On my way there, I realized I forgot my wallet at home...HAHAHA What's up with that?!? How could I forget it!?! I went back home to get it. It was funny how it took me about an hour to get to the grocery as a result...LOL

I got a lot of stuff. Some of it isn't my usually things. And I'll still need to go back this weekend...hehehe I was thrown off a little by the fact I was there on a Monday and I had forgotten my wallet originally. But I got everything I needed for food this week. So, I'm still doing well with not eating out! Yay!!! It was so tempting to eat out, though...LOL

I was able to get outside for a few walks today. It was a very pleasant day to be outside. I had a little bounce in my step today...hehehe

Work wasn't much of anything to write about...so I won't...LOL

I actually don't have much to write about in general today. I had thoughts earlier that floated away...HAHAHA I mostly wanted to write about today's photo (below). I hope to always write about that each day...at least in the photo section. That's where I always put it and then I import it in my blog entry for the day.

But today was a really good day. I just don't remember what I was thinking about earlier that I wanted to write...LOL
