# February 13

I don't have much to say today...LOL But I still had a *Vitamin G*, photo, and I decided to include the *Bible in a Year* reading in this post. It has a neat video about Leviticus from [BibleProject](https://bibleproject.com).

Today's *Vitamin G*:

*When you expect something, you will be disappointed when it falls short of your expectations. So, expect nothing ðŸ¤­ And instead, appreciate everything ðŸ¤—*
