# TBD

I settled in on my plans for grandma's birthday celebration. I'm flying up to Indiana on Friday, March 7th. I'll be flying home the next evening. This will be a quick trip. But I hope to see my son and I'll be there to celebrate grandma's 90th birthday <3

I'd still like to plan a longer trip to spend more time with my son. I may go up for the week of my birthday a few weeks after this quick visit. If I do, it'll be a working trip. I'll avoid taking time off work and spend the evenings with Malachi. I might still take off my birthday and do something special with him. But I'm not sure yet. Work has been a bit busy this year. And it is only going to get busier until at least June. I can take single days off from time to time without feeling guilty or overwhelmed...hehehe
