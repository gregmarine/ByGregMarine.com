## 7:35am

I slept so much better last night. I'm still a little groggy this morning. But I feel far more rested than I did yesterday. Despite how poorly I slept the night before, I had a really good day yesterday. And my spirits were really good all day. With today being a *FriYAY* of sorts, with a 4 day weekend ahead, I imagine today will be pretty good as well. Let's see... together! Join me, will you?! hehehe

## 8:15am

Today's huddle meeting was short. Ross gave me an idea of a musical group to check out on my drive tomorrow. And he gave me an assignment for today... LOL I figured today would be a more relaxed kind of work day. And it will be. But having an assignment feels a little more *worky* than I imagined... LOL But I also wonder if we'll get out early today? At the previous company, it was not uncommon for us to be dismissed around 1 or 2 in the afternoon the day before a major holiday.

## 9:40am

Today's Humpty Dumpty tale was so fun to make. The video Gemini created was a bit disturbing... LOL I'm really enjoying the process of making those each Humpty Dumpty Day... hehehe We've been doing that for months now and have quite the collection of original tales. We never know what he'll be up to each week. But it's something I very much look forward to every Wednesday and I'm grateful for this fun, creative outlet <3

## 12:05pm

I haven't yet gotten around to that task. I was pulled into something else... LOL I'm helping troubleshoot something one of my team members is having trouble with. It has been fun helping out. We haven't quite solved it yet. But I feel like a breakthrough is on the horizon. We have broken for lunch and will regroup this afternoon.

## 2:35pm

I was let out of work early for the holiday after all... LOL After lunch, I worked with my teammate and he was able to resolve his issue. A second set of eyes usually works out well. A little bit later, my boss reached out to thank me for my help and then dismissed me for the holiday. It was basically a 5 and a half hour day... hehehe I'm now off work until Monday! Yay!

## 7:35pm

With the gift of time I was given, I decided to catch up on... TV... LOL I also did laundry and tested out an art app on one of my color eink tablets. I'm getting really good at *not* drawing Oswald... LOL The app kept getting in the way, actually. This was the first time I gave this one a good go of it. I don't think it's right for me. It's called Sketchbook, by the way. My next try will be Clip Studio Paint. I have high hopes for it. The other one I've tried, and enjoy so far, is Infinite Painter. I really wish Procreate was available. I've also tried ibis Paint X. The ads kept getting in the way. I may buy the thing and test it quickly during the refund period. But they also have an additional membership to unlock some things so I'm not sure yet. Clip Studio Paint has a modest annual subscription that I plan to do for the first year. I haven't paid for Infinite Painter yet. It's nice. But I hope to find one that I like most. Something like Procreate. I want something that won't get in my way, I'm a simple person... LOL I don't need much to do what I do for art.

## 10:10pm

I'm mostly packed and ready to begin my journey tomorrow morning. I just have a few things to pack up in the morning. I also had a lovely chat with Mom and Dad. I hope for a nice visit. I'll be away from home 5 days this time. Am I ready to be gone that long? Sure?.. LOL

I ordered a keyboard case for the Tab X C to have by the time I'd be on this trip. It arrived today... LOL It basically turns it into a full computer. I was using a Bluetooth keyboard and a laptop stand to hold the device up to this point. But I wanted something more portable for travel like this. We'll see how that goes.

I'm going into this journey with some hope. These trips can sometimes be rough. Not long ago, I really struggled with going up there. This year has been different. But my last trip up had its challenges. I feel prepared, though. My heart is happy and I have a good feeling.

## 10:40pm

Well, I really like this keyboard case. The keyboard is responsive. The little touchpad it has is convenient. It makes the tablet *feel* like a laptop in a way. I think this will work nicely on my trip. I'm so glad I got the Tab X C, and now this integrated keyboard case. Although I still need the MacBook for certain tasks, this eink setup is working out great. I've decided to leave the MacBook at home this time. So, this setup will be my desktop experience aside from what I have for work. I typed this section of today's entry from this. I love it <3

Happy Thanksgiving Eve <3
