# Happy Heart

### 2025/11/02

One year ago, I was traveling to California for my first ever visit to Disneyland Resort. It was a Saturday when I traveled. Dapper Day was the next day on Sunday. It was an amazing experience. The week included my first Disney experience with Cherie as well.

Two years ago, I was about to participate in the *finish line* of the runDisney race that was the beginning of my health transformation. That was also an amazing experience. My sister joined me for that one. Both of those Disney experiences occurred on November 3rd. Except my day with Cherie; which was on the 8th.

What am I doing on November 3rd this year? I'll be working tomorrow... LOL.

The good news is I'll be at Disneyland Resort with Cherie in two weeks for our first official Dapper Day together. It is also our second vacation together. The first few trips, we were only together for set hours. But August, and now November, the time is measured in days...hehehe. This is so special and makes my heart happy ♡.

Speaking of my heart being happy, it was wonderful being back in church today. I checked the calendar and saw that I did not attend CUMC any of October. On the first weekend, I was at my parent's church. On the 11th, I decided to take that break. I may go back and watch the sermons for all of October. Today's message had aspects that closely related to what I prayed about and discovered this past week. So it was a great way to end the *sabbath* of both October and the Bible study. The week and month of changed focus was just what I needed to align my heart. I'm still far from full clarity. But the path forward is less foggy and some of the distractions are less focused.

I went to Culver's for lunch again this week. I've been doing that before going to the grocery. I went with the breaded tenderloin in honor of Mom. She has officially lost all her hair. I thought about temporarily shaving my head during her season of treatment. But that isn't how my mom feels supported. She likes normalcy. We texted during the games this week. That's how she feels support. Shared experiences, you know? She was rooting for the Dodgers *with* me. The sandwich today was for Mom. It was good and made my heart happy ♡.

I have some new ideas for how I'm going to do some of my artwork. I hope to explore some of that soon. I'm hoping to work on a Bingford sticker this week. If I don't get it completed in time for our vacation, it will at least be a fun project as I'm doing it. And as Cherie pointed out, it will be ready for the Spring Dapper Day.

I also want to do more creative writing. I finally finished the first draft of *Coffee Mug* recently. I'm ready to take on another short story. I've also been thinking about my *Porch* project. With that one, I'm going to create character sheets for all of my characters so far and setting sheets for the various locations in that *world*. Essentially, I want a *Story Bible* to maintain continuity from one chapter to the next. Although each chapter is a short story in and of itself, they all work in tandem to draw the reader into the *world* of the narrator. Organizing this seems like a good idea since it has grown beyond what I originally started a year ago.

We are back on *standard* time today. The game going late last night helped me with the hour we got back this morning. But I had forgotten the time change at sunset this evening... LOL. I was a bit thrown by how dark it was when I looked out. I laughed at myself. I didn't grow up with a time change. I'm used to it now. But my mind still plays tricks sometimes... hehehe.

Speaking of game, the Dodgers are World Series Champions once again! It was a great series and the final game was the perfect way to end it. As a Dodgers fan, I would have loved a *sweep*... LOL. As a baseball fan, it couldn't have been a better series... LOL. They have now won back-to-back. Can they pull off a third next year!? Wouldn't that be something?!
