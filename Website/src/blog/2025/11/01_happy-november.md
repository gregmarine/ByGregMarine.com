# Happy November

## Church

I feel as though this was a successful week with my research into the early church. I've barely scratched the surface, of course. But I'm very happy with finally beginning this journey into what I feel God laying on my heart. I'm far from any conclusions. And I remain a little uncertain about some things. However, I feel so much better having spent these past 6 days doing some research.

As stated the other day, I'll be returning to Sunday church tomorrow with CUMC. I'm so glad to be getting back. I've missed it. I realized I took a break a year ago as well. I thought I had done virtual church every week. But I took a similar break last October as I pondered going back to physical church. Upon my return from California last November, I started going to CUMC virtually and theChapel physically at their satellite location.

## World Series

Well, the Dodgers saved themselves last night and are going into game 7 tonight. I love a World Series where both teams are relatively evenly matched. I'm excited and hope the Dodgers win. But I'm also okay if the Blue Jays win. The baseball and history fan inside of me is grateful for such a good series and all that has happen this year. A lot for the record and history books.

## LEGO Zen

I finished my Japanese Maple Tree LEGO set last night. I love how it came out. I love these LEGO Botanical sets. I'm ready to collect more! I have a feeling I might be getting another set for Christmas. Mom was asking me about the ones I already have...LOL I've started looking into shelving units to display these sets. As the collection grows over the years, I want a proper way to enjoy them. These trees I have now are only the beginning. I love all of the botanical sets. And I'd like to get that LEGO Tranquil Garden set someday.

## Dapper Prep

I'm almost set for my outfits for our upcoming vacation. I'm exploring a few options for Dapper Eve to match Cherie. Dapper Day is pretty set, though. That outfit is the one I wore for Christmas last year. It matches her dress well already. One challenge I'm facing is how I'll transport my hats this time. They aren't crushable and I can only wear one on my head on the plane. I don't do checked luggage. So I'm thinking of how I can work it out to safely have one in my carry-on or backpack. But I'll figure it out. I always do...hehehe I'm sure a box with a hat in my backpack might work.

## E-Ink Journey Continues

As I continue to explore e-ink, I'm back on my Supernote Manta to write this. And I just received another Boox device yesterday. It's the Go Color 7 II. It's about the same size as my Kindle Colorsoft. And will actually replace that Kindle. I really love its size and how well it does for my books. It can also work as a notes device at my bedside. It will be great on the plane as well. Since it is a Boox, it syncs perfectly with my other Boox devices. It may seem weird to have so many different ones. But they all work well for the purpose I got each of them for. There is some overlap in functionality. But each separately excels at different, specific things. I'm glad I've been exploring this and feel I'm close to what I'm trying to accomplish. I still have the Palma 2 Pro on its way. It's suppose to ship on Friday. But I'm not sure it will arrive in time for my trip. I don't need it for the trip, of course.

## Halloween

They had a food truck here last night. It was pretty good. What stood out the most was they had Dave's Killer Bread as an option! So I went with a BLT on Dave's with a side of fries. I went back later and also got a small cup of banana cream pie ice cream. There was also a Trunk-or-Treat for the neighborhood children. This was the first time they've done a Halloween thing here. It was nicely done and I hope they do it again.

## November

Well, November has arrived once again. There's only 2 months left in the year. I'd say that it has been a good year overall. My heart is happy. Especially today. I'm excited to finish this year and welcome the new year soon. It's beginning to feel like Fall here in Florida. I'm sure it won't last long, though. It seems like these low temps are temporary. I never really know. Weather here doesn't make sense to me yet. Anyway, I'm glad it's November now. October wasn't a great month. But I'm okay with that. Welcome, November! I'm glad you're here!

## Dodgers

LET'S GO DODGERS!!!
