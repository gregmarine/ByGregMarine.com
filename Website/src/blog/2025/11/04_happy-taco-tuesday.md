## Opinions

I made my first ghost post on Threads today. It read:

*I used to jump to conclusions about most things. I would form a lot of opinions on little to no knowledge of the subject. I didn't realize how ignorant I was.*

*Now? I'm still ignorant about most things. But I don't take that leap to conclusions or opinions so quickly.*

*And in a lot of ways, I'm just dancing to my opinions now xD*.

When social media first introduced these 24 hours only posts, it didn't make much sense to me. But sometime last year, I decided they can be fun. In this case, I had some rhetorical nonsense I wanted to say while not allowing it to linger on the feed. Yet, I still feel like my rhetoric could use more context. So here I am journaling about it.

Social media has become the common and public place to express our opinions to whomever will listen. And as of my joining the world of Reddit, I've noticed opinion more so. Everyone has one. Some express that what they say is their opinion. Others talk as if their opinion is fact. Regardless, it has inspired me to think about how I come to conclusions and the opinions that are the result. It has even made an impact on how I communicate my opinions when writing or speaking to others.

Most of what I say and write about is opinion. Even when rooted in some knowledge and understanding, I'm realizing that I remain ignorant of a great many things. Especially when I jump to conclusions too quickly. So I take more time to listen, think, and look into most things to increase my knowledge and understanding. Then I might dance my way to a conclusion in due time. My final response might still be an opinion, but it won't be as shallow as a lot of what I see that inspired this train of thought today... LOL.

## Bible Study

This week's lesson has been interesting. I went through the entire thing last night and jotted down some initial thoughts. I left off last night feeling as though I wouldn't have much to say this week. And as I thought about focusing on the first *section* tonight, I wasn't even sure I was alert enough to write much. Boy was I wrong! I was inspired to write for the opening scene, the first mini section, and the first *Your Turn* question as if by surprise that I would have the thoughts I expressed in words. I'm so glad I sat down to go over it tonight after all. I thought I was too tired, but my spirit perked right up and thoughts flowed.

I'm not doing this on my lunch break as I was doing for other lessons in this book. Last week during our sabbath, I used the lunch hour to research those things on my heart. I have continued doing so this week thus far. I'm enjoying this shift in focus. It has been enlightening and has lifted my spirit. I hope to find a way to organize my questions, the findings from my research, and any resulting conclusions I come to. I feel a little like Nicodemus from this week's episode of *The Chosen* (S5E6)... LOL.

## History

I've been watching historical fiction TV shows about a few pivotal moments in the nation's history. *Man Hunt* was about the Lincoln assassination and the search for Booth and his co-conspirators. That was a fascinating watch. And now I'm watching *Franklin* about his role in bringing France into the American Revolutionary War. I'm just starting it. But it seems like it will be good.

It amazes me how close this country has come to either having never existed or how close it came to ending a few times. It puts present concerns into perspective. Recent years have revealed to me parts of our laws and government structure that I don't recall learning about in school. And based on social media arguments, it seems most people don't have a clear understanding of these things either. Our politicians included... LOL.

I won't say I truly understand much myself. But I do find it as fascinating as I do frustrating. I enjoy educating myself on it all. I just don't appreciate the cause of me finally trying to understand these things... LOL. History is being made. And I'm not sure this country is going to like what it's going to look like when we look back. Then again, history is written by the victor....

## Shipped

3 notifications I enjoy as a consumer... Shipped, out for delivery, and delivered. These past few weeks have been exciting as I've received these notifications. A lot of it is for my dapper attire. Some of it has been my e-ink devices. Today, I received a notification that my Palma 2 Pro was shipped. It's coming sooner than expected. That's always fun. Perhaps it will arrive before my trip. If so, I might get to give it a go on that trip. We shall see... hehehe. I also have some final dapper pieces arriving this week. I can't wait to see how everything works out. I absolutely love working on my outfits. I'm glad I picked up this hobby a few years ago. It's so much fun and I feel so happy when I dress up.

## Growing

This month has started off so much better than last month. I'm doing so much better personally as well. I don't know what it is about October lately. I'm grateful for the lessons it teaches me, though. A little pruning has been good for my heart. I'm growing.

Ooh! And Happy Taco Tuesday...LOL
