# Thanksgiving
### 2025/11/23

I plan to begin writing about our November vacation soon. I plan to wrap up my thoughts on our August vacation soon too. And I will likely write about Bingford's visit to Walt Disney World as he went on an amazing adventure yesterday. But today, Thanksgiving is on my heart. So I'm going to focus on that this time.

I'm sure I wrote last year about how I have been in Florida each Thanksgiving for the past several years. Even the years preceding my move here. I haven't celebrated this holiday since the traumatic event on that day in 2009. It has been a difficult thing to get over. I rarely even talk about what happened or how deeply it impacted me. I'm still not quite over it yet, actually.

But so much healing has occurred these past few years. And although I'll still not be with family this year, and I'll technically be starting the day in Florida, my day will end in Alabama. For the first time in years, I'll be outside of Florida on Thanksgiving Day. I see this as a victory over what happened in 2009. And I have a sense of hope for my future feelings on this special day. I might even be with family next year. We shall see <3

Despite what happened, how I feel about it, and the negative impact the event had on me, I never stopped being thankful. I'm thankful every day. The holiday just became another day to me, though. At first it was painful. But then I started coming to Florida instead of family gatherings. And then when I moved, I simply stayed in Florida and did my own thing, even if it meant doing something alone. I still called loved ones to wish them a Happy Thanksgiving, but in my heart, it was just a Thursday.

Well, this Thanksgiving will be much more than just another Thursday. My heart will be celebrating it as the holiday it is meant to be. I won't be with family that day. But I will be well on my way to my family in Indiana. And I'll get to spend an entire week up there. Even if it isn't the best week of my life, I'm so thankful to be going and being there. I don't always have a great time on my visits. There are challenges. The square peg in a round hole sort of thing. But I'm thankful nonetheless.

Don't get me wrong. I have a great family and I love spending time there. I just struggle in some ways. I've never felt like I fit. And that's okay. These past few years have taught me a lot about who I truly am and I'm finding ways to make these visits work. That's how I've increased the frequency and length of my visits, actually. I love them so much and wanted to do what I could to figure this out this year. And overall it is going well.

I'm going to continue working on this area of my life. And I'm going to find new meaning for Thanksgiving Day to replace 2009's Thanksgiving. I'll not forget what happened, how I feel about it, or its impact. Such things are a part of me and that's good for me now. I'm just going to continue to grow from it. I'm moving that part of myself into a different greenhouse where it can now thrive. It will bloom someday and have its season. And when that season comes to an end, I'll have the petals to remind me of the process and the growth it gave me...*wink*

As for this Thanksgiving Day, I'll spend it driving and a night's stay in Alabama. I called the hotel to confirm there will still be a dinner and their restaurant will be open. So that's where I'll be eating that night, per usual when I stay there. I was afraid they wouldn't have that considering the holiday. The hours are slightly modified. But Bingford and I should be rolling in with time to spare.

I'm so very thankful for everyone and everything in my life. Happy Thanksgiving week <3
