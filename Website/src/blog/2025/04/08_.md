## My Day

### 07:55am

I wasn't expecting how much sleep I got last night. I was exhausted early and was in bed by 11:30pm. I woke up at 07:27am...LOL One of my first thoughts was, *I guess I needed it!* The sun is hidden behind a blanket of water vapor (clouds) today and I thought it was probably pretty early when I woke. It seemed like it was early dawn. Nope! It was well past sunrise when my eyes opened...hehehe

### 10:00am

I just joined a meeting at work...it hasn't officially started yet. But the first thing I hear someone say is *he scared the $%&^ out of me*. I hear curse words all the time. I used to say them myself for a few seasons of my life. But at work, I don't feel there is a place for that speech. I'm not judging. Just a time and place sort of thought. A moment later, I was welcomed to the meeting and I wished everyone a Happy Taco Tuesday and said I've been thinking about tacos all morning...LOL No curse words after that...LOL

Well, the meeting is starting now...
