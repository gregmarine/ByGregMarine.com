## My Day

### 07:55am

I wasn't expecting how much sleep I got last night. I was exhausted early and was in bed by 11:30pm. I woke up at 07:27am...LOL One of my first thoughts was, *I guess I needed it!* The sun is hidden behind a blanket of water vapor (clouds) today and I thought it was probably pretty early when I woke. It seemed like it was early dawn. Nope! It was well past sunrise when my eyes opened...hehehe
