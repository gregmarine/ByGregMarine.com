# Thank You, Jesus!

No timestamps for today. I've been enjoying doing the timestamps lately. I like popping in and writing a little each time throughout the day. Alas, today was not one of those days...hehehe

I didn't get to watch today's game. I would have liked to. But my day didn't lend itself to being able to do so.

I had a good day. But I don't have a lot to say about the day itself...hehehe

My new work laptop arrived today. The instructions didn't work for me to get logged into the company network. I couldn't actually log into the computer at all, actually. I may just be misunderstanding the instructions. You know when they say the instructions are written as if for a 6 grader or whatever the saying? Yeah, those are confusing to me...LOL I'll admit, that is one of my weaknesses...hehehe So, I'll have to reach out to IT Monday to find out what I'm doing wrong.

A year ago, I took a brief break from writing. I mentioned back then that writing in this blog was a way for me to empty my mind and make room for some new things. At the time, I had then opened myself up to thinking too much and needed a break from writing so I could stop thinking...LOL Yeah, I don't have that problem anymore. I'm less an overthinker these days. And although writing still empties my mind to make room for new things to think about, I've improved the way I process what I'm thinking about.

Against my better judgement, I found myself at Walmart today. I pop in there from time to time. Today's task was to get some cleaning supplies for my bathroom. I still get those at Walmart. I haven't researched healthier alternatives for that sort of thing yet. Unsurprisingly, Walmart was as chaotic as I remember. The self-checkout line was a mess. I noticed they had some lanes open with an actual cashier that had no lines. So, I popped on over there and was out a lot quicker than the folks over at the self-checkout...LOL I offered my receipt to the gal at the exit and she told me I was *good*...LOL

The song choice for today's photo on Instagram didn't really have much meaning. I looked for a song with meaning. But I ended up choosing something that just sounded nice. The photo doesn't do the sunset justice. Don't get me wrong. The photo is quite lovely. But what I saw with my own eyes was spectacular ðŸ¤©

Easter is tomorrow. I'm happy it has arrived. I'm glad I'm connecting with it now. That began last Easter. It's good to find connections in whatever way we can. And the best way I've found to connect to people, places, and things is through my relationship with God. That was made possible through the reason I celebrate this holiday <3 Thank You, Jesus!
