## My Day

### 04:45pm

Providence doesn't mean miracle. Sometimes, it just means clarity of mind. Sometimes, it means the body doing its natural thing. Sometimes, it means a change of heart. And, yes, sometimes it could be an actual miracle.

Providence can be found in a terminal diagnosis. It can be found in the tears of someone who can no longer hold their child. It can be found in the brokenness of a relationship that is lost forever. It can be found in the storm..

Providence isn't dependant on our state of mind. It isn't about always having the answers. It isn't because we have all of the broken pieces in a tidy order. And it isn't even in our control.

Providence is beyond anything we can imagine. It is beyond anything we can possibly hope for. It is beyond how much faith we think we need to have. It is beyond what we could ever be told.

Providence can come in the laughter of a loved one. It can come by a helping hand. It comes when a blind person shows you the way. It comes a puppy is happy to see you. It comes from a seemingly random word of encouragement from someone you haven't spoken to in a long time.



If God wills something, it happens. I trust Him.
