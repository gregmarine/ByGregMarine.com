## My Day

### 08:05am

That was so nice...I took a morning walk before work. It has been a while! It was a little chilly and I needed a jacket and hat...hehehe But it was well worth it. I took several photos and a video. I got a lot of sleep again last night. But today was a shave day. So I still had time for a walk <3

Communication is hard. What questions do I need to ask? What do I need to say? Am I being clear? Do I understand what is being asked of me or what is being said to me? I expect at the age of 47 I should already be able to communicate well. And maybe I do? But lately, I've felt as if either I am not communicating well or I simply don't understand what is being communicated with me. I've been doing better about not assuming things and asking clarifying questions. But sometimes I feel as though the answers to my clarifying questions aren't the answers to the questions. I may have one context in my mind. And the one answering may have a different context or understanding in theirs.

This came to mind today because I had a question about a technical term in my industry. I went to *the web* for answers. I then asked an AI because I felt like the web search didn't yield an answer. Both gave the same answers...LOL With a computer system like a basic web search or an AI, it is likely impossible to share my context in order to clarifying what I'm asking. With humans, that is a little easier with extra effort by both of us.

But, then again, when I don't understand the answer as being an answer to my question or not, I then ask myself, *Do I really even need the answer?* As for today's technical question, I do not...LOL
