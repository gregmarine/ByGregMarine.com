## My Day

### 08:05am

That was so nice...I took a morning walk before work. It has been a while! It was a little chilly and I needed a jacket and hat...hehehe But it was well worth it. I took several photos and a video. I got a lot of sleep again last night. But today was a shave day. So I still had time for a walk <3
