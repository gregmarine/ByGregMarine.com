## My Day ‚òÄÔ∏è

### 07:50am

It has been a while! My last journal entry was on Easter...hehehe I had quite a week since then. I wasn't able to write. And I've missed this!

I had a staycation last week where my parents came down for a visit. I mostly stuck around the area. That's why I'm calling it a staycation. I took time off. But I mostly stayed at home each night. The only exception was 1 night at Disney's Pop Century hotel. That night, we all had dinner at The Cake Bake for mom's birthday celebration and then we did EPCOT the next day so I could participate in Dapper Day.

I'll probably write a little bit about all of it later today. It was a good week and I'm grateful for their visit. I'm grateful for my parents and I see the Blessing of still having them in my life <3

Today, I'm back to my routine; which includes going back to work...hehehe My boss contacted me about an issue on Wednesday. I felt that was odd because I've never been contacted on my days off. I didn't stress about it, though. I simply answered his questions when I could. It was mom's actual birthday that day and I didn't want to interrupt *her* day. My parents actually do not know work was involved in the day...LOL I didn't say anything about it to them...hehehe

### 09:35am

A major system I'm responsible for is having trouble this morning. It's at the old company. I don't have the access to things I need to actually fix anything...LOL Plus I needed to update some things on my local machine to even look at the code behind things because I no longer do development work for the old company...LOL It has been a bit of a mess. But I'm working through it. I'm taking this quick break because I'm waiting for things to install...LOL

It sounds like it might actually be an easy fix. Some data was purged yesterday as part of the new data retention policy. But it sounds like the indexes weren't updated after the purge. That would definitely explain why the queries are failing with timeouts. Without indexes, queries have to search through all of the data one record at a time like an elderly librarian trying to find a book without a card catalogue to point to which section and shelf the book is on...LOL I think the data guy is rebuilding the indexes now. Perhaps the issue will resolve itself before I even get to look at the code...LOL

At the new company, we are making sure I have the access I need to support these applications. At the old company, I began inheriting it all as we were transitioning over. So, my name is on things, but I don't have access to much...LOL It can be frustrating at times. But I kind of shrug it off in my mind because I can only do what I am able and allowed to do. If my hands are tied, I can't fret over what I can't do to help. I simply help where I can and try to get others involved who do have access and knowledge where I lack.

### 11:15am

It appears the issue was the database indexing. Once that was fixed, everything seems to be working as expected. Yay!!! Hopefully this is the last hiccup with that system that I'll have to deal with. In just 3 weeks, that system will be out of scope for me...hehehe At least on the old company's side. I'll still have it at the new one. But at the new one, I have full access to support it...LOL

My favorite moment last Tuesday was when I saw my parents for the first time. They arrived in the evening and I met up with them and my sister, with her husband, at Rusty Bellies in Tarpon Springs. And my favorite moment from that experience was when one of the specials was crab balls. They said that crab cakes would normally have been the special. But the machine they make those in was down. So they converted them into balls...hehehe My mom lllooovvveeesss crab cakes. You know, the real ones. Those are great down here where I live. So, I was happy she was able to get a new twist on those that night. She lit up like a Christmas tree on that first bite...LOL She shared one of them with me...hehehe That was a great way to begin the staycation with my parents <3
