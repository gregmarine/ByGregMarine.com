# Zeniversary and God's Moments

A year ago today, I was introduced to Zen Kitchen & Bar in New Port Richey. At the time, I was in search of a new *favorite Asian* restaurant in my area. Before going, I pondered if this would be the place. It sounded fantastic. After that first visit that night a year ago, I predicted it would become my favorite local Asian restaurant. A year later, it's still the only one I go to around here...LOL Yep, it's my favorite!

With it being my *Zeniversary*, I prayed about going there for lunch. I didn't want to do dinner because there is a local event going on this week. I didn't feel like dealing with that just to get dinner...LOL That, and I didn't want to miss tonight's Dodgers game ü§≠ I prayed because I've been doing a little something God related when I go out lately. Especially at Zen...hehehe It turned out to be a very Blessed time üôèüôå

This week's Bible study has me doing a great deal of thinking about how I interact with people. I'm looking forward to the discussion this Sunday. But I'm also looking forward to what all of this means as I continue on this journey. God has been doing some amazing things in my heart. This growth has been a Blessing. And I am excited about what God is doing ü§©

Proverbs 3:5-6 was a part of my day again. *Greg, never forget this!*

The Dodgers lost for the first time this season. I enjoyed watching the game, though. It was pretty close. They almost did another come back win...hehehe

Today's photo inspired a thought about perspective. The cloud was tiny...hehehe But it was large enough to block out the sun for a moment. I stopped to admire the moment. And then I captured it. Compared to the sun, the cloud is quite small. The cloud doesn't know that, though. It simply does its job to provide as much shade as it can. All it can see is that it is doing its very best. It was positioned in just the right spot at just the right moment. Despite it's small size, from the perspective of the moment, it was perfect. Later, that cloud will join others and provide needed rain to living things somewhere else. It doesn't concern itself with being smaller than the sun. Even though it is a vapor today, and tomorrow will be gone, it does what it was created to do.

I like that thought. I like the idea of doing what I was created to do. I need not concern myself with how big other things are or what other things are doing. If I'm suppose to *provide shade* today and *provide rain* later, that's what I'd like to do. God will position me in just the right spots at just the right moments. Despite my spiritual size, from the perspective of God's moments, He makes things perfect. Just like that cloud, my life is a vapor that will eventually be gone from this world. *They* say life is short. And from the perspective of time here on earth, sure, that's true. But the reality of existence is that life is forever. When I pass from this age, I will go onto the next. And the next age never ends. While I'm here, I'd like to do what God purposes me to do. After that, I'll go do the next thing He purposed me for...hehehe To worship Him in the Kingdom <3
