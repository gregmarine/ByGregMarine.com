## My Day

### 07:30am

I went to bed a half hour *early* last night and woke a half hour earlier today. I'm getting to observe the sunrise again. And I love it!

I had 2 very odd dreams last night about AirBnBs...LOL The first, it was a *friend's* place that they rented out. I needed to use the restroom and had to be careful not to mess anything up because a new guest was expected that day. One of the bedrooms had these weird window coverings over a window that didn't face the outside. It faced the entryway of the home...LOL But there were 3 coverings. The combinations of how to cover the window were many...hehehe Margot Robbie was who owned the actual property. But my *friend* was who did the AirBnB stuff with it. So weird. Anyway, I *used the bathroom* there, got a demo of that window stuff, and got out of there. The guests would soon arrive! And then I woke up and actually did get up to go to the bathroom...LOL

The second AirBnB dream was my place. I was renting it out when guests needed it and I stayed there myself when no one rented it. That was a little weird. But I had been sleeping there and needed to *get up* and get the place *ready* for the guests who were arriving later *today*. In this dream, it kind of looked like my current apartment. This was the dream I woke up to today. So, perhaps I was half awake and half sleeping...hehehe

### 07:45am

Ooh! I forgot to mention! I began my new scalp treatment last night. Way too early to say if it going to work or not...LOL But I did want to mention that my hair feels different today, in a good way. So something is happening already...hehehe This is a bar shampoo that has *active* charcoal in it. It's a *clean ingredients* product like my other soap bars. I like that it's a bar instead of a bottled liquid. My skin feels a little happier today. But, again, way too early to say if this treatment is going to work. Here's to hoping! ðŸ¤ž

### 11:45am

The day is going well for a workday...hehehe It has been a little busy. But not too bad. Testing with end users is doing well. Some issues were brought up on today's call. I'll be looking into some of that this afternoon. One thing I like about these issues is that it is giving me exposure to the source code of the applications I inherited. I'm learning things I need to know in order to support the applications.

My morning walk was nice. It was very windy...hehehe Almost too windy for a walk. But I muddled through. I experimented with some photography. None of those photos are likely to be chosen today. I didn't even sort them into my candidate folder...hehehe But it was fun to try some new things. That's another reason I wanted to do photos this year. I wanted to learn more and evolve my photo art. It's more than just trying to be present in the moments this year...hehehe

I ran into one of my neighbors. He isn't doing well. He mentioned that he is trying to find a new home for his dog. She's been with him since her birth. She has had special needs from the beginning. They named her Miracle...hehehe Because it was a miracle she lived. She's a senior dog now. So, in a way, he saved her life and she has had a long one, for a dog with special needs. I'll be praying for him to find a new home for her as well as for what he has going on in his life that is causing him to let her go :(
