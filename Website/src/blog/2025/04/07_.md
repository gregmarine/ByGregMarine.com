## My Day

### 07:30am

I went to bed a half hour *early* last night and woke a half hour earlier today. I'm getting to observe the sunrise again. And I love it!

I had 2 very odd dreams last night about AirBnBs...LOL The first, it was a *friend's* place that they rented out. I needed to use the restroom and had to be careful not to mess anything up because a new guest was expected that day. One of the bedrooms had these weird window coverings over a window that didn't face the outside. It faced the entryway of the home...LOL But there were 3 coverings. The combinations of how to cover the window were many...hehehe Margot Robbie was who owned the actual property. But my *friend* was who did the AirBnB stuff with it. So weird. Anyway, I *used the bathroom* there, got a demo of that window stuff, and got out of there. The guests would soon arrive! And then I woke up and actually did get up to go to the bathroom...LOL

The second AirBnB dream was my place. I was renting it out when guests needed it and I stayed there myself when no one rented it. That was a little weird. But I had been sleeping there and needed to *get up* and get the place *ready* for the guests who were arriving later *today*. In this dream, it kind of looked like my current apartment. This was the dream I woke up to today. So, perhaps I was half awake and half sleeping...hehehe

### 07:45am

Ooh! I forgot to mention! I began my new scalp treatment last night. Way too early to say if it going to work or not...LOL But I did want to mention that my hair feels different today, in a good way. So something is happening already...hehehe This is a bar shampoo that has *active* charcoal in it. It's a *clean ingredients* product like my other soap bars. I like that it's a bar instead of a bottled liquid. My skin feels a little happier today. But, again, way too early to say if this treatment is going to work. Here's to hoping! ðŸ¤ž
