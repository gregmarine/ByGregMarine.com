## My Day

### 07:35am

Today's *Bible in a Year* reading was very relatable to me. A few of the Psalms will likely become personal prayers of mine. Psalm 141 and 142 sound like things on my heart lately.

In the Bible app, what I currently use for this reading, the audio portion of Psalm 142 was messed up. It is set to Psalm 126...LOL I've noticed that for a few chapters through the whole Bible, it isn't quite right. It's either the wrong one or the audio and the verses aren't synced up. When that happens, I simply read it aloud myself. As I've been putting each chapter here on my website, I hope I'm always using the correct audio for each. In the future, when I do this *Bible in a Year* plan, I'll just use this website to follow along.

My goal is to remove my dependence on the Bible app. It's nice to have the app. And I do plan to still have *a* Bible app of some kind. I just don't like *that* Bible app much. It has grown too big. I like something simple. When it was first introduced, it was simple. Now they have all kinds of things in it. That is all good and well for most people. So, I'm just speaking about personal preference. There isn't anything inherently wrong with what the Bible app has become.

It has been good to see the sunrise more and more these last few weeks. Even when I'm seeing it from inside, I love it. My apartment faces the east. So I get a good view of it from inside.

Ooh, I just remembered something from yesterday. As I was preparing the *Holy Week & Easter* devotional content for [yesterday](), I noticed that [Matthew 23]() doesn't have a verse 14 in most modern translations. There is a footnote that some manuscripts have a verse 14. But all of the translations I typically use in my studies do not include the verse itself. Only the footnote about it. This discovery is one of the reasons I love that I've been working through the Bible on this website *by hand*. I've touched each chapter that I've setup here. I'm not using some sort of tool to automatically do any of it. By intimately doing this process, I'm discovering things about the Word I have never known. I'm not just droning through the Word. I'm consuming it. I love that!

Here is what some manuscripts have for Matthew 23:14 that aren't included in most translations today:

Yesterday, I failed to talk about a dream I had the night before. So, here I am talking about it today...LOL

I've had those dreams where I wake up praying for someone in my life. It happens enough to call it *common* for me. Well, the night before last, I had a dream where I woke up praying for a woman. I did not recognize her. But in the dream, it felt as if I knew her. The dreams itself wasn't about me praying. But when I woke, I found myself praying for her in the same manor I would for someone I know in real life.

I've had a few times in my life when I would have a dream about someone and later in life I met them in person. In one case, I had the dream years before I met them. When I did eventually meet them, I didn't recognize them from the dream at first. But the night of the day I met them, I had the same dream again and connected the dots the next morning.

The mind is a powerful thing and God has some interesting things He can do with it. I cannot say I understand any of this. And I'm not saying *God spoke to me*. I just wonder what it all means. There is scripture that supports the idea that God, or one of His angels, can come to us in our dreams. And, again, I'm not saying that is what is happening with *me*. I'm curious about these sort of things and it's fun to think about.

By the way, none of these dreams aren't influenced by a *substance*...HAHAHA 🧘‍♂️😂
