## My Day

### 07:35am

Today's *Bible in a Year* reading was very relatable to me. A few of the Psalms will likely become personal prayers of mine. Psalm 141 and 142 sound like things on my heart lately.

In the Bible app, what I currently use for this reading, the audio portion of Psalm 142 was messed up. It is set to Psalm 126...LOL I've noticed that for a few chapters through the whole Bible, it isn't quite right. It's either the wrong one or the audio and the verses aren't synced up. When that happens, I simply read it aloud myself. As I've been putting each chapter here on my website, I hope I'm always using the correct audio for each. In the future, when I do this *Bible in a Year* plan, I'll just use this website to follow along.

My goal is to remove my dependence on the Bible app. It's nice to have the app. And I do plan to still have *a* Bible app of some kind. I just don't like *that* Bible app much. It has grown too big. I like something simple. When it was first introduced, it was simple. Now they have all kinds of things in it. That is all good and well for most people. So, I'm just speaking about personal preference. There isn't anything inherently wrong with what the Bible app has become.

It has been good to see the sunrise more and more these last few weeks. Even when I'm seeing it from inside, I love it. My apartment faces the east. So I get a good view of it from inside.

Ooh, I just remembered something from yesterday. As I was preparing the *Holy Week & Easter* devotional content for [yesterday](), I noticed that [Matthew 23]() doesn't have a verse 14 in most modern translations. There is a footnote that some manuscripts have a verse 14. But all of the translations I typically use in my studies do not include the verse itself. Only the footnote about it. This discovery is one of the reasons I love that I've been working through the Bible on this website *by hand*. I've touched each chapter that I've setup here. I'm not using some sort of tool to automatically do any of it. By intimately doing this process, I'm discovering things about the Word I have never known. I'm not just droning through the Word. I'm consuming it. I love that!

Here is what some manuscripts have for Matthew 23:14 that aren't included in most translations today:
