## My Day ☀️

### 07:55am

I was able to add the *Bible in a Year* reading to the website again this morning. I like that I've been doing that right after doing the reading and listening to *The Bible Recap* podcast...hehehe

That said, I'm very distracted this morning. I think I slept okay and I was able to wake in plenty of time for everything I've done this morning so far. I feel well rested. But my mind is thinking about all sorts of things today...hehehe Nothing heavy, though. Just a wandering mind that can't seem to focus on just one thing at a time. Perhaps I'm ready for the weekend?

One thing that keeps popping up in my mind is what I'll be doing for work today. I try not to think about work outside of work hours. But I'm pretty excited about what I'll be learning today through finding a solution to the challenge that came up yesterday. I love to learn new things :)
