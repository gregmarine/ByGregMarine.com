## My Day

### 08:25am

I'm beginning to *see* some progress on my sleep schedule adjustment. This week, I've been able to wake on my own with time to start my day with some Bible time. That was my primary goal. I'm not doing the *The Chosen* Bible study in the morning yet. I'm not sure if I'll ever get to that. The problem with doing that one first thing is I typically have a time constraint of being ready for work. I don't want to ever rush that study. I cannot predict how much time that one will take daily. I've had times when a single question could take me an hour to answer. And I've had times when I was able to do the entire lesson within only a few hours. So, what I've been doing this week so far is reading the *Bible in a Year* reading and *The Bible Recap* podcast. That is a predictable 20-30 minutes. And instead of doing that at lunch, I've been doing the *Holy Week & Easter* devotional. Which leaves *The Chosen* Bible study for the evenings. 3 spiritual meals a day is working out nicely...hehehe

I'm also feeling less drained in the middle of the day lately. I am getting a little more sleep on average than I was prior to this change. And it seems to be helping. Also, I feel less stressed to be getting ready when I wake up. It feels more relaxing when I open my eyes because I have more time before work begins. I'll keep with this change for as long as it is effective and see how it goes. If I've learned anything about my routine these last few years, changing things around every few months makes a positive impact. When I start to settle into something, it's effectiveness wears off and I need to change. So, by the summer, I'll likely be changing things up again...LOL

### 09:00am

God may not always spare us from earthly consequences, but He does go through those consequences *with* us. There is comfort in that thought.

> John 16:33 ~ *I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world!*

On another note, a *happy accident* led to me getting different bread for my morning toast this week. It's still Dave's Killer Bread. But it isn't my usual small and thinly sliced loaf. And it isn't the bagels. Both where out of stock this week. So, I went with the larger size loaf of the 21 whole grains and seeds. I like the size and slice thickness better so far. I'm happy with this change...hehehe
