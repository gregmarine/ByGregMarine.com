# TBD

Lately, I've been thinking about what I value and what sort of value I put on what I value. What are the things that I invest my time and heart into and why? I've also thought about these past few years and the changes and growth I'm experiencing. Not to mention where my priories are now and how to know what those priorities should be. It has all been fascinating to think about. Some of which has gone into my study notes for the Bible studies I've been in with Cherie. These thoughts continue beyond the Bible study and I'm thinking about them often.

One of the rhetorical questions I posed in a devotional note last year was *How do I even know what my priorities are?* A lot of thought went into that question. Sadly, my notes didn't reflect that. It doesn't even look rhetorical at face value. Of course I know what the definition of *priority* is and I know what all of the obvious ones *should* be. It was more of a question of *was I understanding life as it is or should be* as compared to what I actually perceive it to be.

At the time, I was coming to realize that most things I had learned weren't at all what they appeared to be. Either I was believing some of the lies I was told or I completely misunderstood certain things. I was going through a process of tossing out most of what I thought I knew to make room for learning how things truly are. I was facing the reality that *my* reality was being viewed through the wrong lens. Or at least a lens that was way out of focus or even broken. Even the *mirror* I was looking in to see myself was poorly reflecting who God created me to be.

Let's just say, there are a lot of good and bad reasons my life has turned out the way it has and why my perspectives have been so far off most of my life. I sometimes wonder if other people have had this conflict in their hearts as well. Perhaps that is one more reason there is so much brokenness in the world? The eyes of the heart aren't seeing clearly what truly is and isn't? Once again, rhetorical.
