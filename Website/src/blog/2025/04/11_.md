## My Day

### 11:45am

This morning has been one of *those* mornings...LOL This week as been one of *those* weeks, actually. I almost made a social media post...hehehe I decided not to. I wanted to express how I didn't like *it*...meaning, I didn't like how this week has been and how this morning had been going. I'll probably write more about this later today. We'll see.

Part of the morning I really didn't like is that I didn't have my breakfast and coffee at my usual time. That coupled with new meetings popping up today, I won't be able to take an actually lunch break. I may try to make a *normal* lunch to eat during one of the meetings. With my current diet, timing is important. But today is a lesson in being better prepared for when I have one of *these* days...LOL

I was able to get out for a short walk today, though. I only got in 1 lap...LOL A third of a mile is better than no walk at all. I saw something beautiful; besides the sunrise...hehehe After I took my sunrise photo, a saw an osprey take off from one of the trees and circle the pond. He perched back up on top of one of the trees. Shortly after, I saw him dive down from the tree straight into the pond. With a great splash, he had secured his breakfast. I then saw him launch out of the water like a fountain of hope with what he had secured. A fish was held tightly in his talons as he soared off into the distance. I imagine he found a nearby parking lot light to sit on and have his breakfast. Good job little buddy! Enjoy your food. God does provide!

Although I don't always like what is happening and how it makes me feel, I'll not allow things to *ruin* my hope. My hope is in the LORD. But I still don't like *it*...HAHAHA

### 12:45pm

We've booked our tickets to see *The King of Kings* tomorrow. For me, it's around 2pm. For her, it's around 11am. I'm excited for this film. I think I mentioned this yesterday...but I like how this one is being told.

This is getting me thinking about going to another movie tonight too. I've been wanting to see *Captain America: Brave New World* in the cinema. It has been out for a while now. I don't know how much longer it will be. I wanted to go these past few weekends. But it hasn't worked out. Tonight would be a good time to go if I decide to. Two movies in a row?

I took another 1 lap walk around the pond a little bit ago. Even though I haven't been able to do my usual walking today, I'm grateful I have been able to walk at all. This is part of things I don't like today...hehehe I want to walk, walk, walk...LOL I'll take what I can get. God is good <3
