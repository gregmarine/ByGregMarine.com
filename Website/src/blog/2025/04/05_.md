## My Day

### 07:15am

Today is starting off earlier than most days lately. I woke up around 6:20am. It took a while before I actually got out of bed because I felt like I might fall back to sleep. I did not...hehehe It has been a rough morning so far. But that's okay. I've been having some really great mornings lately. It was bound to happen sometime...LOL I went to bed about the same time as I normally have been lately. Something that has happened often is that my white noise app would end around 6:30am. I typically lay down around midnight now and the app is currently set for 6 and half hours. After it turns off, I've been sleeping anywhere between 45 minutes and a hour longer. Most days, I don't even notice that the app has stopped. Today, I woke up to go to the bathroom a little before the app was going to end. I started it a little before midnight last night. So, at around 6:21am, it stopped and I was wide awake. I'd like to end my dependence on the white noise. I've been using something like this since 2017 or 2018. Before that time, I would use ear plugs for a few months. The white noise helped the most at the time. But now it seems I need it all the time. And I don't like that...LOL I'm just such a light sleeper mostly. Anyway, one good thing is that I am seeing the sunrise today. I haven't been opening my window blinds until after the sun has already risen. I didn't go outside to watch it. But my window blinds are open and I can see the sky changing as the sun is rising today. Perhaps this will reset my day and get it going on a smoother path ‚òÄÔ∏è
