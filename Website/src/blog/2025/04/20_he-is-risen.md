# He is Risen!

Happy Easter! Aka, Resurrection Sunday ðŸ™Œ He is risen! Without what Jesus did, what we celebrate today, there would be no hope. Everything He said and did would have meant nothing without His overcoming death through His resurrection. Next, we get to celebrate His ascension into Heaven to sit at the Righteous Right Hand of the Father...hehehe And the Holy Spirit coming! That'll be June 8th this year.

The first part of my day was spent in prayer, Bible reading and study, and church. This is how most of my Sundays have been going lately anyway...hehehe But today's felt a little extra special. I had gotten up early so I could attend the sunrise service. But they didn't stream it...LOL So, that gave me an extra hour I didn't know I'd have. Although I would have loved to watch that early service, I'm grateful for the time I spent in the Word alone instead.

I went to my sister's house for the afternoon for Easter dinner. I really enjoyed it. I think this was my favorite Easter in a while. I hadn't been with family for this holiday in quite some time. Last year, I had brunch with friends. I don't recall what I did the few years before that. It was her and her husband, his mother and brother, and some friends of his mother. And me, of course. My sister and his mother had prepared some Easter treats for everyone. For dinner, we had ham and some sides. It was very lovely.

After dinner, we all went outside to play corn hole. It's basically a game where you toss a bag filled with corn at a board on the ground with a hole in it...hehehe There are 2 teams with 2 players each team. It's a fun way to enjoy a simple sport with great fellowship with friends and family. We had 3 games and alternated players. It was fun!

After that, we all went inside for dessert and to just chat before folks started to leave. I hung out a little longer since I had time and I don't get to see my sister and her husband nearly as often as I'd like.

The treats were candy. I gave up those sorts of treats a little over a year ago. I had been addicted to sweets and finally overcame that. I still have the healthy chocolates and cookies I've been snacking on in the evenings for a while. But I hadn't cheated with the sort of sugary candy you have at holidays like Easter. I recently decided I would be okay to cheat from time to time. So, I'll be eating what they gave me today. I had a little bit of it tonight. I may have a little more tomorrow. Just a little bit each time until it's all gone. In the past, I would have already eaten all of it. Probably while sitting there at dinner today...LOL Even after the little bit I had tonight, I'm not craving it. I should be good to not recede back into the addiction.

I dressed retro today. I wanted to dress up a little for Easter. But I didn't want to go full dapper. I wasn't sure what it would be like at the gathering. I really loved how I looked and felt today. I also got very positive feedback on my attire. But most importantly, *I* really loved it. I don't mean that in a selfish or prideful sort of way. I just mean that it is important that we like how we feel. This is a new concept for me considering what I've been through in life. So, how I felt today means a great deal. Having the feedback was in addition to that feeling.

What I wore reminded my sister of 50's Prime Time CafÃ© at Disney's Hollywood Studios...hehehe That's actually why I bought the shirt and I told her it is what I'd like to wear the next time I go there...hehehe Except I'd add a hat. I didn't wear a hat today.

Because of my upcoming staycation, I started this week's Bible study early. I'm almost finished with it, actually. It is another lesson with impeccable timing. That's how God's timing works...hehehe As of this coming week, we will be 2 lessons into this book. We'll go over both next weekend. But I have to say, this book is taking things to a new level. I think all of the books have been stepping it up each time, actually. Is that how these things are supposed to work? I suppose so...hehehe This journey over the last year was unexpected. And definitely a Blessing!

I keep calling my vacation a staycation. That's because I'll be mostly staying near home. I only have 1 night that I'll be in a hotel. The other nights, I'll be at home. I'll also have time alone each morning. The rest of the time I'll be spending with family.

I'm planning to shift my sleep schedule again. I'm going back to something similar to before. The sleep I have been getting has been good. But I don't like the schedule itself. I feel like I have less time than I did last month, before changing. I keep running out of time in the evenings before I'm *done*. And the *extra* time I have in the mornings hasn't been as impactful as the time I used to spend late at night. It was worth a try, though.

This past week was a good week. I'm looking forward to the coming week. My heart is happy <3
