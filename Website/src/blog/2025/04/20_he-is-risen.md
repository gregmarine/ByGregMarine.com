# He is Risen!

Happy Easter! Aka, Resurrection Sunday ðŸ™Œ Without what Jesus did, that we celebrate today, there would be no hope. Everything He said and did would have meant nothing without His overcoming death through His resurrection. Next, we get to celebrate His ascension into Heaven to sit at the Righteous Right Hand of the Father...hehehe That's be June 8th this year.
