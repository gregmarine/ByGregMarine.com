# He is Risen!

Happy Easter! Aka, Resurrection Sunday ðŸ™Œ Without what Jesus did, what we celebrate today, there would be no hope. Everything He said and did would have meant nothing without His overcoming death through His resurrection. Next, we get to celebrate His ascension into Heaven to sit at the Righteous Right Hand of the Father...hehehe And the Holy Spirit coming! That's be June 8th this year.

The first part of my day was spent in prayer, Bible reading and study, and church. This is how most of my Sundays have been going lately anyway...hehehe But today's felt a little extra special. I had gotten up early so I could attend the sunrise service. But they didn't stream it...LOL So, that gave me an extra hour I didn't know I'd have. Although I would have loved to watch that early service, I'm grateful for the time I spent in the Word alone instead.

I went to my sister's house for Easter dinner for the afternoon. I really enjoyed it. I think this was my favorite Easter in a while. I hadn't been with family for this holiday in quite some time. Last year, I had brunch with friends. I don't recall what I did the few years before that. It was her and her husband, his mother and brother, and some friends of his mother. And me. My sister and his mother had prepared some Easter treats for everyone. For dinner, we had ham and some sides. It was very lovely.

After dinner, we all went outside to play corn hole. It's basically a game where you toss a bag filled with corn at a board with a hole in it...hehehe There are 2 teams with 2 players each team. It's a fun way to enjoy a silly sport with great fellowship with friends and family. We had 3 games and alternated players. It was fun!

After that, we all went inside for dessert and to just chat before folks started to leave. I hung out a little long since I had time.

The treats were candy. I gave up those sorts of treats a little over a year ago. I had been addicted to sweets and finally overcame that. I still have the healthy chocolates and cookies I've been snacking on in the evenings for a while. But I hadn't cheated much with the sort of candy you have at holidays like Easter. I recently decided I would be okay to cheat from time to time. So, I be eating what they gave me today. I had a little bit of it tonight. I'll have a little more tomorrow. Just a little bit until it's all gone. In the past, I would have already eaten all of it. Probably while sitting there at dinner today...LOL Even after the little bit I had tonight, I'm not craving it. I should be good to not recede back into the addiction.
