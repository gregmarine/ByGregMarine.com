# It is Finished

## My Day ‚òÄÔ∏è

### 07:55am

I was able to add the *Bible in a Year* reading to the website again this morning. I like that I've been doing that right after doing the reading and listening to *The Bible Recap* podcast...hehehe

That said, I'm very distracted this morning. I think I slept okay and I was able to wake in plenty of time for everything I've done this morning so far. I feel well rested. But my mind is thinking about all sorts of things today...hehehe Nothing heavy, though. Just a wandering mind that can't seem to focus on just one thing at a time. Perhaps I'm ready for the weekend?

One thing that keeps popping up in my mind is what I'll be doing for work today. I try not to think about work outside of work hours. But I'm pretty excited about what I'll be learning today through finding a solution to the challenge that came up yesterday. I love to learn new things :)

### 02:30pm

Challenge accepted, challenge overcome! That work issue has now been resolved...hehehe It had a simple solution in the end and everyone is happy. The *fix* will go in on Monday by the data folks. All of the other testing has received approvals as well. So, good news all around on this *Good Friday*...hehehe

In an effort to resolve this today, I somewhat skipped my lunch break. I did eat and still did [today's *Holy Week & Easter devotional*](/bible/plans/holy-week-easter/6). I just didn't get to *step away* like I usually do. That's okay, I'll be away for 3 days next week...hehehe

Over the past year or so, a lot of plans changed or got canceled. I was reminded today of where I had planned to be this week. I was originally planning to be in Japan...LOL I was going to go to Tokyo Disneyland, Disney Seas, and Star Wars Celebrations. The Star Wars event was the reason for the timing. The other Disney stuff was going to be in addition to that. Plus, I would have explored as much of Japan as I could while there. I might have done more than a week, perhaps.

The Star Wars announcements started rolling in. I'm a fan and enjoy seeing these things. It would have been great to be there in person...hehehe I have a friend who is there at the moment. I also had another friend who was at Tokyo DL and DS this week. It would have been great to see them all.

There was a time in my life when I would have been sad to be missing out on something like canceled plans. But I'm actually happy and excited to see the announcements and posts without feeling that sadness this time. I'm happy where I am today. I don't mean physically being at home...LOL I mean mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Although it would be great to be in Japan right now, it is equally great to be at home (yes, this time I mean physically at home LOL).

When I was originally making plans for Japan, I didn't know I'd be at a different company. I didn't know we'd be just weeks away from a huge event at work that would require my presence and focus at this specific time. And I didn't know that I would be fortunate enough to see my mother on her birthday. By the way, I'll be seeing my mom on her 70th birthday next week...YAY!!!

A change in one set of plans opened up my life to all sorts of other things. I may eventually get to Japan. I still have hopes to live there for a year. But I'm also okay if that never happens.

### 08:10pm

What a beautiful service <3 I just finished watching the CUMC Good Friday service.

There are many days worth celebrating. There are many seasons to connect my heart with. But Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter are among the most important days for me. The arrival of our Savior, the sacrifice of our Savior, and the resurrection of our Savior. Thank you, Jesus, for coming, dying, and rising <3

*It is finished...*

### 09:00pm

I had another day where I only went for the 1 walk right after work. It was a beautiful evening to be out. It's still too dry. We really need rain and there isn't any in the forecast. The fires have gotten worse and burn bans are going into effect. I think this is the first time I've experienced a drought since moving here. I've experienced droughts before, though. Back in Indiana. I'm glad the fires aren't threatening populated areas. But I feel for the wildlife that's impacted. Despite the human population and over development, there is still a large wildlife presence in Florida. But wildfires are a natural part of Florida's ecosystem. So, this might be good thing for those areas?

Speaking of wildlife, we are in alligator mating season. I haven't seen any alligators in this season yet. But if I do, I'll be extra careful. They get aggressive for the season and a lot hungrier...LOL There remains a good presence of birds around the pond. So far, that appears to be a sign that there aren't any alligators. That's been my experience since moving here, anyway...hehehe

I'm getting to watch tonight's ballgame üíô I don't like missing the games. But I'm very grateful when I do get to see them. I'm still hoping to get to go to a game in August. And I am thinking about going to some Spring training games next year. At least those here near me.

I have a friend who is *collecting* ballparks. He is a Yankees fan. And he has been trying to go to as many Major League ballparks as he can. He is still young. I imagine he'll have quite the *collection* someday. I need to check in on him and see how many he's already been to...LOL I did talk with him today. But it was about Good Friday and Easter. Not baseball...LOL

### 10:00pm

I totally forgot to mention this the other day...LOL There is a toddler and his young mother I have been seeing on some of my walks lately. He can't be more than 18 months old. He smiles and waves at me every time we cross paths...hehehe The other day, he waved, got all excited, and showed me a rock he found <3

It reminded me of some young boys I saw on a hike I took in North Carolina last year. I took a photo of the family for them. But the young boys were excited to show off the rocks they had found...hehehe

It's really easy to take all of worries, sorrows, and pain to God in prayer. We want healing and peace. But what if we were to take our joys to Him like those children did when they showed me their rocks? That's something I've been trying to get better at lately.

Perhaps the hardest part of taking our joys to God is that it is often difficult to find the joy in the first place. When we experience so much trouble in our lives, it becomes harder to focus on what is good. Our minds tend to focus on the pain, I think. At least, that's been my experience. As I listen to others, I think they go through the same thing. The more I practice showing God the *rocks* (joys) I find, the easier it has become to find them. He still cares about the troubles. But I know He also cares about the amazing *rocks* I show Him...hehehe
