# It is Finished

## My Day ‚òÄÔ∏è

### 07:55am

I was able to add the *Bible in a Year* reading to the website again this morning. I like that I've been doing that right after doing the reading and listening to *The Bible Recap* podcast...hehehe

That said, I'm very distracted this morning. I think I slept okay and I was able to wake in plenty of time for everything I've done this morning so far. I feel well rested. But my mind is thinking about all sorts of things today...hehehe Nothing heavy, though. Just a wandering mind that can't seem to focus on just one thing at a time. Perhaps I'm ready for the weekend?

One thing that keeps popping up in my mind is what I'll be doing for work today. I try not to think about work outside of work hours. But I'm pretty excited about what I'll be learning today through finding a solution to the challenge that came up yesterday. I love to learn new things :)

### 02:30pm

Challenge accepted, challenge overcome! That work issue has now been resolved...hehehe It had a simple solution in the end and everyone is happy. The *fix* will go in on Monday by the data folks. All of the other testing has received approvals as well. So, good news all around on this *Good Friday*...hehehe

In an effort to resolve this today, I somewhat skipped my lunch break. I did eat and still did [today's *Holy Week & Easter devotional*](/bible/plans/holy-week-easter/6). I just didn't get to *step away* like I usually do. That's okay, I'll be away for 3 days next week...hehehe

Over the past year or so, a lot of plans changed or got canceled. I was reminded today of where I had planned to be this week. I was originally planning to be in Japan...LOL I was going to go to Tokyo Disneyland, Disney Seas, and Star Wars Celebrations. The Star Wars event was the reason for the timing. The other Disney stuff was going to be in addition to that. Plus, I would have explored as much of Japan as I could while there. I might have done more than a week, perhaps.

The Star Wars announcements started rolling in. I'm a fan and enjoy seeing these things. It would have been great to be there in person...hehehe I have a friend who is there at the moment. I also had another friend who was at Tokyo DL and DS this week. It would have been great to see them all.

There was a time in my life when I would have been sad to be missing out on something like canceled plans. But I'm actually happy and excited to see the announcements and posts without feeling that sadness this time. I'm happy where I am today. I don't mean physically being at home...LOL I mean mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Although it would be great to be in Japan right now, it is equally great to be at home (yes, this time I mean physically at home LOL).

When I was originally making plans for Japan, I didn't know I'd be at a different company. I didn't know we'd be just weeks away from a huge event at work that would require my presence and focus at this specific time. And I didn't know that I would be fortunate enough to see my mother on her birthday. By the way, I'll be seeing my mom on her 70th birthday next week...YAY!!!

A change in one set of plans opened up my life to all sorts of other things. I may eventually get to Japan. I still have hopes to live there for a year. But I'm also okay if that never happens.

### 08:10pm

What a beautiful service <3 I just finished watching the CUMC Good Friday service.

There are many days worth celebrating. There are many seasons to connect my heart with. But Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter are among the most important days for me. The arrival of our Savior, the sacrifice of our Savior, and the resurrection of our Savior. Thank you, Jesus, for coming, dying, and rising <3

*It is finished...*
