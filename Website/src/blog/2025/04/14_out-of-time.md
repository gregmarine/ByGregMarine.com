# Out of Time

I'm not sure how this is possible, but last week, and now this week, I keep running out of time for the day...LOL From the moment I wake up, to the moment I lay my head, I've gone none stop. And now, I have run out of time to write out a full journal entry...LOL

I wanted to at least write today about how I'm doing a Holy Week & Easter devotional plan this week. Below, you can see links to them so far. They are quick and worth checking out.

Also tonight, I'll be trying out scalp treatment five...hehehe Since *Head and Shoulders* is the only one that worked in the past, I decided I would look into their new *Bare* version. Alas, it still has nonsense in it. It is much better than their original, though. But it did lead me to understand the main dandruff fighting ingredient. It's Pyrithione Zinc. I did some research into that to see how it works. It is different than all the other things I've tried. Perhaps my problem has always been what it solves since H&S is the only thing that has ever worked for me. I saw that both the FDA and European Union approve it as safe at 2%. It isn't enough that that FDA does. The fact the EU does as well makes me feel better. I did some further research into better products that have ZnP and found one by Noble Formula that truly only has the bare essentials. So here's to hoping ðŸ¤ž

This week is going really well so far. Last week needed to happen. But I didn't like it...hehehe I'm grateful for what I went through last week. And I'm very happy that this week *feels better*.

This week's Bible study lesson is a hard one, in a good way. I'm looking forward to diving into it this week. I've already watched the episode (S4E1), read the book's introduction and first lesson, and began praying about all of it. This will be a good challenge throughout the week <3

Something I noticed today is that I'm sort of doing 3 *meals* a day this week for my Bible time...hehehe The Bible in a Year, the *The Chosen* Bible study, and the Holy Week & Easter devotional. Each typically won't take up too much time each day. The one that takes the longest typically is *The Chosen*. I've been hungry for the Word, and He is satisfying me. And I've noticed that this is happening no matter what I do for the Word. Even on days when I only have time for something small and quick, I'm satisfied. My *daily bread* fills me up <3

Well, that's all for today. I need to shower and get to bed soon. Today was a good day. I loved today <3
