## My Day

### 07:50am

I've been through today's *Bible in a Year* reading and have already added it to the website...hehehe I think this is the first time I've already added everything to the site for that reading plan. I typically wait until the end of the day to do all of that.

I decided to try that today because yesterday was so long. The day went really well. But by the time I was working out things like that, it was late. I didn't leave myself time for a shower last night. It's a good thing I didn't get too dirty yesterday...hehehe I suppose I could have still taken a shower. But I wanted to get to bed so I could wake early enough to do this morning's reading before work.

Yesterday had the added moment when I do my weekly call with my parents. So, that contributed to the busyness of the day. It is such a Blessing to have my parents.

Today is *Maundy Thursday* in the *Holy Week* calendar. Today is the day we celebrate the Last Supper and the time when Jesus gave us Holy Communion. Tonight, I'll be tuning into the CUMC service.

### 11:25am

I've run into a challenge at work this morning. I enjoy a good challenge...hehehe It helps me grow. In this case, professionally. Hopefully, by the end of the day, I will have met the challenge with a solution.

A lot remains on my mind and heart. I *feel* so much better this week than I felt last week. But so much of what I've been thinking and praying about is still hovering over me. And it keep tapping me on the shoulder...LOL I can see another season of growth here in my newest personal year. I'm grateful for that <3

I haven't been outside yet. It looks like it will be a bit warmer today than it has been lately. It is inching its way back to being hot. By the time I have my Dapper Day next weekend, it will be hot. I've been rethinking what I'll be wearing. It is considerably hotter than it was last April when my dapper life began. I may need to go with one of my retro outfits instead of my full on fancy dapper. The *real feel* for that day in the Disney area is forecast to be in the 90s. Which means, even for me, it will be hot in dapper attire. And even with my retro, I'll be wearing pants.
