## My Day

### 07:50am

I've been through today's *Bible in a Year* reading and have already added it to the website...hehehe I think this is the first time I've already added everything to the site for that reading plan. I typically wait until the end of the day to do all of that.

I decided to try that today because yesterday was so long. The day went really well. But by the time I was working out things like that, it was late. I didn't leave myself time for a shower last night. It's a good thing I didn't get too dirty yesterday...hehehe I suppose I could have still taken a shower. But I wanted to get to bed so I could wake early enough to do this morning's reading before work.

Yesterday had the added moment when I do my weekly call with my parents. So, that contributed to the busyness of the day. It is such a Blessing to have my parents.

Today is *Maundy Thursday* in the *Holy Week* calendar. Today is the day we celebrate the Last Supper and the time when Jesus gave us Holy Communion. Tonight, I'll be tuning into the CUMC service.
