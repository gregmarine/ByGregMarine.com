# Zeniversary

A year ago today, I was introduced to Zen Kitchen & Bar in New Port Richey. At the time, I was in search of a *favorite Asian* restaurant in my area. Before going, I pondered if this would be the place. It sounded fantastic. After that first visit that night a year ago, I predicted it would become my favorite local Asian restaurant. A year later, it's still the only one I go to around here...LOL Yep, it's my favorite!

With it being my *Zeniversary*, I prayed about going there for lunch. I didn't want to do dinner because there is a local event going on this week. I didn't feel like dealing with that just to get dinner...LOL That, and I didn't want to miss tonight's Dodgers game. I prayed because I've been doing a little something God related when I go out lately. Especially at Zen...hehehe It turned out to be a very Blessed time 🙏🙌
