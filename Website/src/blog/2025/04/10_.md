## My Day

### 09:45am

I wrote out most of my day yesterday in a timestamp journal that I didn't published. This week, I am trying out a new day and time for my weekly call with my parents. I moved it from Sunday to Wednesday. It works out better for us all...hehehe But that meant I didn't have any time last night to finish up things here. I decided not to publish any of my words from yesterday. So, here are the highlights.

One of the best things about yesterday was that I was able to get in a morning walk before work. I was able to see the sunrise from outside. It had been a while! I was also able to do that today! I've missed that. It remains to be seen if this is officially back into my routine. We shall see! But I also walked 6 times yesterday. That was a first. Every 2 hours or so, I went for a one mile walk. I loved it! And I was also able to see the sunset again! That's now twice in less than a week...hehehe I did a lot of praying on those walks. That's why I took so many yesterday. Lots to pray about. In reading what I wrote yesterday, I think prayer was the most significant part of my day.

An issue came up at work yesterday with one of my apps that I inherited. I spent half my work day on it...LOL One of my walks was used to pray about the issue. I went with a prayer based on Proverbs 3:5-6. When I got back to the computer, the problem was resolved. My boss asked if I had done anything to fix it...LOL I did tell him that I prayed for wisdom, knowledge, and understanding...LOL He said, *well, the universe responded*...hehehe We don't discuss religion. But we do talk about stoic philosophy and the existence of a higher power. I honestly do not know where he stands on God versus *gods* versus the universe. But I do know he always appreciates our conversations about how to deal with life.

There was another prayer I spoke to God about. There were 6 moments yesterday that felt like answers to that prayer. They were moments of Peace that directly related to what the prayer was about. That doesn't always happen. Especially so quickly after a prayer. I suppose the prayer and the *answers* were just *that* important? I know that in the Word, when God repeats Himself, those are things we should pay close attention to.

Well, that's the basic gist of yesterday. Like I said above, I was able to get outside for an early morning walk again today. It was a great way to start the day. And work is going swell so far today. I'm unlikely to do 6 walks again. I'm always praying. But I don't need to go on walks to do that. Yesterday just happened to be *that* kind of day. Ooh...and the 6 moments of Peace weren't related to the 6 walks. They were 6 *other* moments...hehehe
