## My Day

### 09:45am

I wrote out most of my day yesterday in a timestamp journal that I didn't published. This week, I am trying out a new day and time for my weekly call with my parents. I moved it from Sunday to Wednesday. It works out better for us all...hehehe But that meant I didn't have any time last night to finish up things here. I decided not to publish any of my words from yesterday. So, here are the highlights.

One of the best things about yesterday was that I was able to get in a morning walk before work. I was able to see the sunrise from outside. It had been a while! I was also able to do that today! I've missed that. It remains to be seen if this is officially back into my routine. We shall see! But I also walked 6 times yesterday. That was a first. Every 2 hours or so, I went for a one mile walk. I loved it! And I was also able to see the sunset again! That's now twice in less than a week...hehehe I did a lot of praying on those walks. That's why I took so many yesterday. Lots to pray about. In reading what I wrote yesterday, I think prayer was the most significant part of my day.

An issue came up at work yesterday with one of my apps that I inherited. I spent half my work day on it...LOL One of my walks was used to pray about the issue. I went with a prayer based on Proverbs 3:5-6. When I got back to the computer, the problem was resolved. My boss asked if I had done anything to fix it...LOL I did tell him that I prayed for wisdom, knowledge, and understanding...LOL He said, *well, the universe responded*...hehehe We don't discuss religion. But we do talk about stoic philosophy and the existence of a higher power. I honestly do not know where he stands on God versus *gods* versus the universe. But I do know he always appreciates our conversations about how to deal with life.

There was another prayer I spoke to God about. There were 6 moments yesterday that felt like answers to that prayer. They were moments of Peace that directly related to what the prayer was about. That doesn't always happen. Especially so quickly after a prayer. I suppose the prayer and the *answers* were just *that* important? I know that in the Word, when God repeats Himself, those are things we should pay close attention to.

Well, that's the basic gist of yesterday. Like I said above, I was able to get outside for an early morning walk again today. It was a great way to start the day. And work is going swell so far today. I'm unlikely to do 6 walks again. I'm always praying. But I don't need to go on walks to do that. Yesterday just happened to be *that* kind of day. Ooh...and the 6 moments of Peace weren't related to the 6 walks. They were 6 *other* moments...hehehe

### 01:30pm

Danielle sent me a text about her new grandbaby <3 My heart is so happy for her and the family. Her children and grandchildren are so important to her. I appreciate that she kept me in the loop on this exciting new part of her journey <3

I've only taken 2 walks so far today. And only 1 more is planned for later. I normally take one right after work. But today, I may hold off and do it at sunset. My walks are little slower today.

I've been less myself on my walks this week. With the exception of people I've interacted with before. Those folks seem happy to see me...hehehe But for people I haven't seen before, or those who never seem to respond to my *hello*, I've simply smiled and waved. I don't like the idea of losing that part of me. But the culture down here is different than what I grew up with. So, perhaps its time to make this change permanent? I still get to be *myself* at places like Disney.

### 02:15pm

Communication is hard. *What questions do I need to ask? What do I need to say? Am I being clear? Do I understand what is being asked of me or what is being said to me?* I expect at the age of 47 I should already be able to communicate well. And maybe I do? But lately, I've felt as if either I am not communicating well or I simply don't understand what is being communicated with me. I've been doing better about not assuming things and asking clarifying questions. But sometimes I feel as though the answers to my questions aren't the answers to the questions. Or what I'm saying was misunderstood because the responses to what I said don't always align with what I said. I may have one context in my mind. And the other person may have a different context or understanding in theirs.

This came to mind yesterday because I had a question about a technical term in my industry. I went to *the web* for answers. I then asked an AI because I felt like the web search didn't yield an answer to *my* question. Both gave the same answers...LOL With a computer system like a basic web search or an AI, it is likely impossible to share my context in order to clarifying what I'm asking. With humans, that is a little easier with extra effort by both of us.

But, then again, when I don't understand the answer as being an answer to my question or not, I then ask myself, *Do I really even need the answer?* As for yesterday's technical question, I did not...LOL And when I feel the person I'm talking to didn't understand what I said, I sometimes ask myself, *Did I really need to be understood?*

When something is important, though, all of those latter rhetorical questions are moot. When understanding is vital, so is communication. No matter how hard it may seem. That's when the former rhetorical questions come into play. Communication really *is* hard. For my at least. That's why I want to continue to grow in this area.
