Testing is going well at work. There were a few issues that I've had to work through this week. But I've been able to quickly resolve those issues with the Grace of God. I've been calling upon Proverbs 3:5-6 through work this week. That prayer has brought me comfort and clarity.

I posed a question today to someone from the change management team. I pondered if all of our applications that are moving from the old company to the new needed to go through the full change approval board process before the *Big Bang* next month. Or were they somewhat *grandfathered* in as approved since they are part of this big effort. Since we aren't actually changing the applications, I hoped they didn't need to go through the whole thing. That question is still up in the air. But the good news is that anything they want us to do before the *Big Bang* is going to be more of a formality for documentation sake. Meaning, it all is technically approved already. They just don't know yet how they want to document that...LOL But after this effort is complete next month, new changes will definitely go through the normal process once it is all established. And rightfully so ;)

On Tuesday, I received a pair of comments about my appearance when I posted that I was thinking about tacos. With the post, I included one of my *so I was thinking* poses...LOL On Twitter, the comment was of concern. They asked if I was doing well as I am looking rather thin. They were concerned that I might have been sick considering how different I look now. On Facebook, the comment was more of a congratulations for having lost so much weight. Both comments were well intended. I have no reason to think otherwise based on who said them.
