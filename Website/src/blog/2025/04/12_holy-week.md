# Holy Week

Holy Week is here!!! This year, I started it a day early...hehehe I count today because we saw *The King of Kings* today. I absolutely loved it. I definitely recommend the film. Especially those with children. The story telling was amazing. The animation style was spot on for my artsy eye...hehehe I really loved that. They didn't use voice actors. They used regular *on-screen* actors for the voices. But I think it works well since all of them tweaked their sound in such a way that you don't *see* the actors through their voices. And the characters weren't animated to *look* like their actor counterparts like they sometimes do with animated films. Per usual, I stayed through the credits. In doing so, I was able to see that Oscar Isaac did the voices for both Jesus and Satan. I haven't found that listed anywhere else. But I did see it in the on-screen credits...hehehe I loved that choice. Satan is known for masquerading as an *angel of light*. So having the same actor doing both voices has some symbolism I can connect with. I have no idea if that was their intent, though...LOL

Well, treatment number 4 has not resolved my dandruff. It's as if I'm doing nothing...LOL I've seen zero improvement with all 4 that I've tried. And these aren't cheap...hehehe I saw that Head & Shoulders has a new *cleaner* option. I may look into that. The original H&S is the only one that has ever worked for me. But I was hoping to find something that isn't full of things it doesn't really need. The latest treatment I tried has charcoal in it. The others I've tried have tea tree leaf extracts or something. I don't fully understand these things, actually. I read and research. What I've read hasn't aligned with my experience. That tends to happen a lot with me for other areas of my life, actually...HAHAHA Maybe I just don't understand what I'm reading?! LOL ðŸ˜­ Or I'm just very unique!? LOL ðŸ˜­ I'll keep trying...
