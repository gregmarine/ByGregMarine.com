# Holy Week

Holy Week is here!!! This year, I started it a day early...hehehe I count today because we saw *The King of Kings* today. I absolutely loved it. I definitely recommend the film. Especially those with children. The story telling was amazing. The animation style was spot on for my artsy eye...hehehe I really loved that.

They didn't use voice actors. They used regular *on-screen* actors for the voices. But I think it works well since all of them tweaked their sound in such a way that I didn't really *see* the actors through their voices. And the characters weren't animated to *look* like their actor counterparts like they sometimes do with animated films.

Per usual, I stayed through the credits. In doing so, I was able to see that Oscar Isaac did the voices for both Jesus and Satan. I haven't found that listed anywhere else. But I did see it in the on-screen credits...hehehe I loved that choice. Satan is known for masquerading as an *angel of light*. So having the same actor do both voices has some symbolism I can connect with. I have no idea if that was their intent, though...LOL

Well, treatment number 4 has not resolved my dandruff. It's as if I'm doing nothing...LOL I've seen zero improvement with all 4 that I've tried. And these aren't cheap...hehehe I saw that Head & Shoulders has a new *cleaner* option. I may look into that. The original H&S is the only one that has ever worked for me. But I was hoping to find something that isn't full of things it doesn't really need. The latest treatment I tried has charcoal in it. The others I've tried have tea tree leaf extracts or something. I don't fully understand these things, actually. I read and research. What I've read hasn't aligned with my experience. That tends to happen a lot with me for other areas of my life, actually...HAHAHA Maybe I just misunderstand what I'm reading?! LOL üò≠ Or I'm just very unique!? LOL üò≠ I'll keep trying...

I had a really good day, today. I love today. The photo I chose to feature reminds me of Olaf...hehehe Well, one of his arms, anyway...LOL I chose *When I am Older* for the Instagram post. That's the Olaf song from *Frozen II*. I had several candidates today. And it took almost an hour for me to pick one. I really loved all of today's photos. I like when it is difficult to chose. It shows just how good a day it was...hehehe

There was an issue with building and deploying my website last night. It eventually went through. I *published* during the 4th inning of last night's game. But it didn't actually get online until toward the end of the game...LOL I ended up seeing the entire game. The Dodgers won. Tonight, well, the Dodgers are 'Gering üò≠ Hopefully they can turn this thing around before the end of the game...LOL

Tomorrow is the official start of Holy Week with Palm Sunday. I'm extra excited for Holy Week this year. Last year, I tried to reconnect with the Holiness of Easter. I did so by observing Holy Week through CCGS. I'll not be doing that this year. But I'll do my own thing. And I'll do the services for CUMC this week. This year is special because it is the first year that I'm truly connected with the week. I say it that way because I wasn't already connected with it last year...hehehe Last year just opened me to reconnecting. Connection is really important to me on this journey. I don't like just going through the motions with anything I'm doing.

I'm so happy today was a good day. This has been a difficult week. God got me through it. Here's to hoping that this Holy Week is an amazing week üôèüôå
