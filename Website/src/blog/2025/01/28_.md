# TBD

I had an amazing day! I kept notes throughout the day so I could journal about it all. And I took 65 videos...LOL I'll have to sift through the videos before I can build a video journal from them. I'll likely choose videos based on what I write about the day. The parts of the day I made note of are the most...*noteworthy*...moments...hehehe

## My Day

### 9:00am

I had a bit of a late start to my day. Basically, I did end up going to bed around 1am like I planned. I woke up at 7:30am, also like I planned...hehehe I decided I would go about my morning pretty much like usual...with a few small changes. I brewed my coffee, made my cinnamon toast, and did today's *Bible in a Year* reading and recap. I was basically in no rush...hehehe

Even when I got ready for my dapper day at Disney, I took my sweet time getting dressed. I wanted to be sure everything was perfect before I walked out the door. I also wanted to be sure I didn't forget to wear my pin. I wore the matching castle *Dapper Day* pin I got for my deerest friend and me last year in California. She wore hers today too...hehehe We were twins!

I wore the magnetic *Mickey ears* she gave me with the hat my parents gave me...hehehe They seemed to work perfect. I just had concerns if the wind would knock them off...hehehe

### 9:20am

Well, I'm off to Disney! I often wonder what my neighbors think of my dapper attire when I leave home on days like this...LOL I have no idea if any of them see me or not. No one has said anything yet...hehehe
