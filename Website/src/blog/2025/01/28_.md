# TBD

I had an amazing day! I kept notes throughout the day so I could journal about it all. And I took 65 videos...LOL I'll have to sift through the videos before I can build a video journal from them. I'll likely choose videos based on what I write about the day. The parts of the day I made note of are the most...*noteworthy*...moments...hehehe

## My Day

### 9:00am

I had a bit of a late start to my day. Basically, I did end up going to bed around 1am like I planned. I woke up at 7:30am, also like I planned...hehehe I decided I would go about my morning pretty much like usual...with a few small changes. I brewed my coffee, made my cinnamon toast, and did today's *Bible in a Year* reading and recap. I was basically in no rush...hehehe

Even when I got ready for my dapper day at Disney, I took my sweet time getting dressed. I wanted to be sure everything was perfect before I walked out the door. I also wanted to be sure I didn't forget to wear my pin. I wore the matching castle *Dapper Day* pin I got for my deerest friend and me last year in California. She wore hers today too...hehehe We were twins!

I wore the magnetic *Mickey ears* she gave me with the hat my parents gave me...hehehe They seemed to work perfect. I just had concerns if the wind would knock them off...hehehe

### 9:20am

Well, I'm off to Disney! I often wonder what my neighbors think of my dapper attire when I leave home on days like this...LOL I have no idea if any of them see me or not. No one has said anything yet...hehehe

I should get there in 2 hours...

### 11:26am

I arrived safely at EPCOT. I didn't run into any significant traffic. Even that little 3 mile stretch of I-4 wasn't very bad today. It was a great day to be traveling to Disney...hehehe I parked in Dory 411. I remember when parking out there would require me to use the tram. My health journey has brought me to wear I'm excited to walk the full distance without using the tram. Even after a long day today, I'll likely walk all the way back to my car...hehehe

### 12:40pm

When I got into the park, I got a selfie with the festival sign and then got a set of PhotoPass photos in front of Spaceship Earth...the big EPCOT ball...hehehe I've gotten into the habit of getting PhotoPass photos when I do a new dapper outfit. Which has been every time so far, since I've only been doing this recently...hehehe One of the PhotoPass photos looks like a selfie...hehehe The photographer set it up for me and I think it looks fun!

Then I headed over to try my first festival food...the crab slider! It was fantastic! People joke about it being Sebastian from *The Little Mermaid*...LOL Now, why in the world would I eat him?!? HAHAHA

After the amazing crab slider, I enjoyed the beautiful sax sounds of Don Black. He was performing as part of the festival. I even did a little dancing to his music...hehehe No video proof of that, though...HAHAHA You'll just have to trust me...HAHAHA
