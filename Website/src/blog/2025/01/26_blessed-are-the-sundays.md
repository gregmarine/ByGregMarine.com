# Blessed are the Sundays

## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Today is the first of 3 reflection days to conclude this years prayer and fasting season. This has been a blessing once again. I had my doubts going into the new year as to whether or not I'd do it this year. I stuck with it because I remember how impactful it was the other 2 years I've started off the year this way. I'm glad I did again this year and plan to continue next year <3

Although I stopped journaling about it, I did go through the entire book of John. It is 21 chapters long. So I read a chapter each day for the 3 weeks. Since I was doing a devotional book on Jesus' prayers, it seemed only fitting to go through the story about Jesus' time on earth...hehehe It was something else I was glad I did <3

## My Day

I went to sleep around 1am this morning and woke at 7:30am. I feel fantastic...hehehe My attempt to return to a more *common* sleep schedule for my timezone was futile. At least for now...LOL I don't know when my next California trip will be this year. But if I keep with this schedule, jet lag will not be an issue...HAHAHA

I suppose one of the reasons I was trying to shift back was due to my starting off my days with the 21 day devotional I've been doing. I wanted to do that and take a prayer walk before work each day. That meant getting up earlier. Well, last week, my morning prayer walks pretty much ended. I think I only took 1 the whole week due to the weather. Prior to that, I went 18 straight days walking 3-5 miles a day...hehehe

Speaking of walking, I forgot to mention yesterday that I took an evening walk. Yesterday's weather was weird. In the morning, the windchill was in the 20s. That's dangerously cold where I live. Especially with that wind coming off the gulf. But in the afternoon and the evening, it was in the 60s! I didn't even wear a jacket for my walk...LOL I don't know exactly how far I walked. I just kept walking until I felt like stopping. I think it was just over a mile, though...or at least a mile...because I went more than 3 laps around the pond.

I was able to take a few walks today too. It was the perfect day for walking. The day was gorgeous! I realized today that I put too much emphasis on how much walking I've been doing. Sure, exercise is nice. But it doesn't have to be a set routine. I'm not training for anything...LOL So, I think for now, I'll just walk and not even keep track of number of laps or what pace I'm going. I'll do what feels right for the day...hehehe

I had some minor struggles through the Bible study for this past week. But when I went to review it all after church today, I found that it all worked out well...hehehe For some reason, in my mind, I thought I had trouble answering all of the questions. But with a clear head today, it turned out all my answers were spot on with how I feel. I guess I just needed to get out of my own head...LOL

So, during our fellowship time, it was one of the most impactful Bible study fellowships I've ever had. I love that we are doing this. It is making a huge difference in our separate journeys. And it is helping us on the part of our journey we share together. Sundays are definitely the highlight of my week.

As part of Sundays being a highlight, church has been going very well. Now that my 21 day season is over, I feel it is time to mention this. Last year, I struggled with where my church home would be. I had left theChapel for a time. But I returned there temporarily in November for a few weeks. During the past 21 days, finding a church home was one of my main reasons for fasting and focusing. I've decided theChapel is once again my church home. These last 3 weeks of going there have been such a blessing. I'm glad to be officially back <3

I'm also still tuning into the CUMC modern worship with my deer friend. It isn't my church home. But it is an important part of our fellowship like the Bible study is.

That's pretty much my day on Sundays...LOL And I love it all!

## Wrapping Up

Today was a really good day. I find it interesting that Sunday is my most packed day of the week. Yet, it is also the most relaxing. Today was even more so because of the beautiful walks I had on top of the fellowship, church, and my weekly call with my parents.

This week should be a good week. I work tomorrow. Then I'm off to a magic day at Disney on Tuesday. Then back to work the remaining 3 workdays. And that will wrap up the first month of 2025!

This week's Bible study will be on *Blessed are the Peacemakers* <3

I added my profile photo to the main page of the website. Not the main page for this blog. But the [Home](/) page. It matches with the one I have for my social media profiles. I'll try it out for a bit and see if I like it here too...hehehe
