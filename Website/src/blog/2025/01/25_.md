## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Once again, I cross another finish line. I think I need more seasons like this. Not necessarily prayer and fasting seasons. But intentional seasons. Something that has a beginning and an end that has some thought put into it. I could have special decorations for these seasons. I could have special meals. I don't really know what all yet. But, as I think back on the last 21 days, it makes me so happy to have measurable experiences that have made an impact on my life.

With the upcoming Valentines Day holiday, perhaps I could have a season of celebrating love. Both God's Love and my love for others. I have a week left in January. I could spend the next week thinking about how I could celebrate love this year. For today, though, I'm ready to cross this season's finish line...hehehe

It has been good to specifically journal about these prayers in this season. This has been a sort of blueprint for one aspect of Jesus' prayers by one author of one devotional...hehehe I hope to explore His prayers more this year.

I noticed from my journal last year, I didn't specifically write about my prayer focuses. I just journaled in general and I could see how last year's season made an impact over the 21 days. This year, I get to see both the focuses and the impact...hehehe

Of course, I haven't written about the specifics of what I have been praying and fasting over. I've only written about the extra focus. I have specific things I pray over outside of this devotional. The devotional was just a guide to learn something new about praying in general...hehehe

That's why I get spiritual fatigue in these seasons. It isn't just what I write about. There is so much more to it. For the things I don't say here, I can with confidence tell you that I have grown once again. God is guiding me through all of the other things I've been praying about. And my heart continues to transform.

I encourage anyone who has a relationship with God to practice prayer and fasting seasons. It doesn't have to always be just at the beginning of the year. In fact, last year, I had several of these seasons. This one that starts off the year is just sort of a beacon that I like to do specifically. But there are so many other reasons to dedicate focus to praying and fasting. Especially with big decisions or changes that happen in life.

I know these seasons have changed my life. I'm different now. I'll remain different. God is good <3
