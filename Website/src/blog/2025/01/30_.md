## My Day

### 07:40am

I found myself in bed late again last night. And I woke up earlier than expected. But I did wake on my own. So, I must have had plenty of sleep...hehehe Sleep has been a mystery to me for as long as I can remember. It has been a topic I've written about often in my blog over the past year. It is even something I track as part of my health. It is very important to overall wellbeing. I'm glad I feel well rested today. I need clarity of mind for work...hehehe

I decided not to take a walk this morning despite being up early enough to have taken one. I felt like staying in for now. I may take a short break after a few hours of work to get outside. I've learned that getting a walk in before I start work isn't as important as I thought a month ago...hehehe Slower mornings tend to give me a more calming experiencing transitioning from sleep to work. At least for the time being...LOL
