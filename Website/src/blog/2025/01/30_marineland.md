## My Day

### 07:40am

I found myself in bed late again last night. And I woke up earlier than expected. But I did wake on my own. So, I must have had plenty of sleep...hehehe Sleep has been a mystery to me for as long as I can remember. It has been a topic I've written about often in my blog over the past year. It is even something I track as part of my health. It is very important to overall wellbeing. I'm glad I feel well rested today. I need clarity of mind for work...hehehe

I decided not to take a walk this morning despite being up early enough to have taken one. I felt like staying in for now. I may take a short break after a few hours of work to get outside. I've learned that getting a walk in before I start work isn't as important as I thought a month ago...hehehe Slower mornings tend to give me a more calming experiencing transitioning from sleep to work. At least for the time being...LOL

### 09:45am

I was thinking what my first attraction would be if I were designing a theme park. I think I'd start with one of those rides like *Frozen Ever After* or *It's a Small World*. The reason is that families could enjoy such an attraction together. Multiple generations could share the same boat, get the attraction photo together, and sing along with the songs. Olaf is the main reason I love *Frozen Ever After*. But I also love how I see families enjoying it together. That's my favorite thing about going to Disney. The thrill rides do not provide that.

I have often waited with my mom while the rest of our family goes on the thrill rides. She doesn't really like them. And she actually can't do most of them anyway. So we sit, talk, and people watch together. We interact with other guests. I love those special moments with mom <3

### 10:15am

Hmmm...for my theme park...what would I name it? LOL Marineland is a little on the nose at this point...HAHAHA I'm known for warm hugs. But having that in the name sounds a little invasive for those sensitive to touch. I'm also known for my *Vitamin G*...hmmm *Vitamin G Acres*? *Vitamin G Gardens*? Hmmm... I'll have to give this some more thought...hehehe

### 02:45pm

It has been another busy day at work. But I was able to get outside for a morning walk around 10:30am. I hope to get back outside this afternoon or early evening. It is such a beautiful day <3

I've been very productive. I've managed to fix some of the issues being discovered in testing. It is good to knock those out. It will help us be more ready for when these applications go online in production in a few months. This phase of testing is supposed to be finished tomorrow. I'm not sure all of the testing will be complete. This may continue into next week a little.

I thought about going to Zen this evening for their Chinese New Year special. I don't think I'll go. Between having gone there on Saturday and my day at Disney a few days ago, I think I'll be staying in tonight. Plus I'm planning to spend some time with my sister on Saturday. I imagine we'll be eating out. I really don't won't to go back to my old habit of going out all the time.

### 08:15pm

Surprisingly, I'm not very tired...LOL I must be getting the best sleep of my life. Because I'm getting a little less than usually lately and still fully functional...hehehe Today has been a really good day <3

I'll be having my evening coffee and snack soon. But I wanted to pop in for a moment. I just got off the phone with my son. It was a wonderful moment. We mostly talked about movies. He gets passionate talking about them. So he was full of excitement tonight. It makes my heart happy <3

I had fried rice again tonight. I can't seem to get enough of it...hehehe I'll have it again tomorrow too...LOL Tomorrow, I'll be doing shrimp fried rice. Tonight's was marinated tofu again. I think I may get some chicken this weekend. I have been craving chicken.

### 10:40pm

I created the video journal from my day at Disney. It's a little long at 7:32. But I like how it turned out. The first 10 seconds has no audio. I tried to add music to that section. But the app removed the audio from the rest of the video...LOL I'll have to figure that out for next time. I decided to leave those 10 seconds without audio for this time. I still have to upload it. I hope to link to it in today's blog entry.

I'm so glad I captured so much in video. Having this video journal took me back to the entire experience <3. It's neat how I could take an 8 hour day, reduce it to 7 and half minutes, and that is all it takes to relive the entire day <3 Plus, I was able to grab photos from the entire day from those videos, [as you can see from the blog entry that day](./28_dapper-makes-me-happier-and-a-celebrity). This is going to be a fun way to capture the moments this year. And doing so didn't take away from the experiences. It just adds to it. I didn't have my phone out much throughout the day. Just for those short clips I captured and some texts I sent. I had more than half the battery left at the end of the day...LOL

### 11:00pm

The video is ready! You can see it [here](https://youtu.be/jqJqHJdvjKw)!

I'll add it to my blog entry for that day as well. That way I can watch it anytime I read that entry again...hehehe

And with that, I'll call it a day!

*There's a great big beautiful tomorrow...shining at the end of every day* <3
