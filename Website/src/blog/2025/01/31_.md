## My Day

### 07:55am

We have arrived at the end of the first month of 2025. I have a lot to look back on for this year already! And I have officially documented it all right here on my blog. For the very first time, I wrote in this journal everyday for the month! Plus, I've featured a photo everyday. I didn't have a goal to write everyday. But I did set a goal to have a least 1 picture to represent each day. It wasn't a resolution. Just a goal...hehehe

I'm also doing really well with all of my resolutions so far. With God's strength, I'll continuing strong in those areas as well. In those cases, I am resolute to keep to them...hehehe
