# Thought Disorientation, Hot Water, and *Stuck* Inside

## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

I accidentally did tomorrow's prayer focus reading this morning...oops! So, I went back and read today's. I'll save tomorrow's for tomorrow. But it was a little disorienting this morning for a moment as I tried to refocus...hehehe

## My Day

Well, I slept in again today. I probably shouldn't have...LOL I was a little disoriented in thought. But I was well rested...LOL

I dealt with a little bit of anxiety all day. I'm not quite sure where that was rooted. It wasn't debilitating in any way, though. I went about my day, minus my walks, like most other workdays :-) And I had a very productive day at work!

As I mentioned above, I started off with the wrong day in my prayer devotional...LOL I had bookmarked tomorrow's instead of today's when I finished yesterday. It all worked out, though. I'll just reread it tomorrow and do my prayer. I realized it before I did my prayer...hehehe

I was stuck inside again today. The weather hasn't been great. But I can' complain. We need the rain and the colder temperatures are good. I love the cold now. I just don't like the mix of cold, wind, and rain for my walks...LOL But it isn't anything like the freezing temperatures up in Indiana!

I miss doing my creative writing. I'm hoping to get back to that next week. I have some things on my mind that I'd like to write. It's been building up creative pressure in my brain...LOL

I downloaded a new (to me) photo and video app to try on my phone. It's called Prequel. I went with the free trial. When it loaded, it offered me a $14.99/yr for life deal immediately...LOL I went ahead and signed up for that. If I don't like the app in the trial, I can cancel. If I don't like it after a year, I can still cancel. But if I do like it, it sounds like it will always be $14.99/yr...LOL Not a lot to lose with that deal...LOL

It seems nice. It has a lot of neat effects. For photos, the effects alone are worth it. But it also has a bunch of video stuff too. I hope the editor works well. We shall see!

I don't have a lot to say today. I didn't write throughout the day. I didn't have much time, actually. I was busy from one task to the next...hehehe
