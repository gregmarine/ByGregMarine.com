# One for All, All with the One

## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

I can see the finish line...hehehe Tomorrow is the last day for this prayer and fasting season. In the devotional I'm doing, there are a few days that will follow this season. That's due to some review chapters in the book. So, technically, it is a 24 chapter book. With those being review chapters, I still feel it aligns well with tomorrow being the last day for the focused prayers. And it will give me some time to reflect on what this year's season has meant for me.

## My Day

I didn't wake when my white noise app ended today. I woke up about 20 minutes later. I don't even recall that app slowly fading and ending. I must have either been in a deep sleep or dreaming something that couldn't be interrupted...LOL This rarely happens. I usually hear the white noise end...hehehe

I feel well rested today. Not just physically. But also mentally and spiritually. I fell asleep praying. I remember waking in the middle of the night still praying. I envisioned little bubbles with our prayers in them floating to heaven and popping right next to God's ears. When they popped, He could hear our prayers. It was a beautiful vision <3

Speaking of beautiful visions, the sun is back! It has been a few days since I've seen it...hehehe It's far too cold to be outside this morning. But I imagine I'll be able to get outside a few times today. That's going to be really nice. I miss the warmth of the sun on my face.
