## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

As I mentioned yesterday, I had read today's devotional yesterday by mistake. I made sure to bookmark tomorrow's correctly...LOL I truly connect with today's prayer focus. And it sparked a reminder about one of my personal philosophies...hehehe

## My Day

Today started off quite a bit better than yesterday. I remembered to read the correct devotional, for one...LOL I didn't intentionally sleep in today, either. I didn't immediate get up when my white noise turned off. But I did wake feeling well rested. And I read today's chapter in the book of John; which was chapter 19. The days I slept in, I didn't read it until later in the day due to limited time before starting work...hehehe

How I start my day really does impact the rest of the day. Likewise, how I end my day impacts the next day. I've known this for a while now. But I don't always put that into practice. For one reason or another, I have those days when I don't pay enough attention to that. The last few days feel as though I missed it...LOL I'm back on track last night and today, though...hehehe

Yesterday, I did my first *Vitamin G* for the year. It was a soliloquy. I ended yesterday's blog entry with it...hehehe I reworded it slightly for the blog. But on my socials, I wrote it as if I were talking to myself. In the blog entry, it was as if talking to a friend about myself...if that makes sense?

I tend to write in this blog as if I'm writing to a friend. It is mostly to my future self. But it could also be viewed as if I were talking to anyone else who reads this. I think that's why my writing as evolved over the last year. I've been reading my past entries each day now. Some of *how* I wrote was cumbersome, and confusing at times. I'm trying to write more conversationally now. Does it *sound* better? HAHAHA jk

My work computer is updating. So I thought I'd pop in and do a quick update. Today is going well so far. User acceptance testing as begun on the apps I support now. A few issues have come up. Most of them I've already fixed. I'm dealing with some today that I'm unfamiliar with that will take a little more time. Nothing to stress over, though.

Pastor Jason from theChapel called and left a message. I returned his call. But it went to a general voicemail box. I don't know what he wants to talk about. He didn't leave details in his message to me. Just that he wanted to talk. He's the pastor *in charge* at the satellite location here in Port Richey. I'm guessing he just wants to talk about that location...hehehe Hopefully we can connect. I'd love to chat with him.

I just read last year's blog entry for this date. I was waiting for this one as I remembered it well. In it, I describe how I was physically, mentally, and spiritually exhausted that week. It was the final week of the prayer and fasting season. I wondered if I'd experience the same this year. In a way, I have. The weather caused me to stop my physical activity outside. That forced me to rest my body. Yesterday, I experienced inexplicable anxiety. Albeit, it wasn't all that bad. I got a little disoriented with my prayer focusing yesterday and a little today. And I'm struggling with this week's Bible study from *The Chosen*.

There's a lesson in here...LOL I need to work in breaks on the weekends between weeks in this season. There may be more to it than that. But that seems to sum it up.

Back to the struggle with this week's Bible study. The episode (S2E6) hits home with me. And the study guide is opening my heart to some things. The questions are a bit tough for me to answer. I know all of the answers will come. I just don't know what they'll look like. I often answer and then re-answer. This week, I feel like I'm forcing my answers. I almost want to write my answers, but then not read them in our fellowship call. I want to just speak and discuss. I know that may not make sense. That's part of my problem this week. I know what to say with my voice...but not with my writing. Which is the opposite of what I normally do. I normally do better writing than I do speaking...LOL
