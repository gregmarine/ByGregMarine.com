# TBD

Today was a good day. I took 3 walks. They were shorter than other times I've done that. I think I walked about 2 miles total? Plus that approximately 1 mile I walk around just going about my day. The weather was perfect for being outside. So, I'm glad I went out...hehehe

I decided not to journal about the reflection day from that prayer devotional I've been doing. It was getting redundant here...LOL I'll just finish organizing all of that on the [Bible](/bible) section later this week and not do anything else here in my blog about it...hehehe
