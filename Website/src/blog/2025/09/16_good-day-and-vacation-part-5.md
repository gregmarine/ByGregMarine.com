# Good Day and Vacation Part 5

## 7:50am

I didn't sleep well last night. I'll be fine, though. I normally sleep so well that when nights like this happen, I'm usually okay. I had a few vivid dreams. One was very sweet and the other was not. But I do like when I can remember my dreams regardless. I'm sure I'll have a good day, I'm in a good mood. I'm just a bit tired right now. Perhaps my toast and coffee here in a bit will give me a boost? I'll consider an earlier bedtime tonight as well.

## 9:40am

With one of my dreams last night, I wrote down what I could when I woke up from the dream. I was still mostly asleep. But jotting some notes helped me to later write a dream journal about it. I'll not be posting that here. But I wanted to mention it because I've been doing some dream journaling lately. Having my digital notebooks has inspired me to write down a lot of things. Digital *paper* is seemingly limitless. So I don't mind jotting random things now. And I can later refine the writing like I did with that dream journal this morning. Today is going well so far <3

## 11:50am

I've decided not to post the video montage of my writing workflow. I thought I had planned out the shots and recorded well. But the edited piece didn't come together. Music may have helped. But I doubt it. I had ambitions to do video journals this year. I never got good at that. At least my writing workflow has improved this year. If I ever decide video journal will be something I'll work on, I'll probably invest in better tools. Like a dedicated camera and better software. I'm likely to get the camera. I do have a desire to capture more video. But I'm still unsure about making video journals. I'll always share some videos, though.

## 2:00pm

I'm taking a slightly different approach to the Bible study this week. I'm handwriting some notes as I go through it. But I think I'll wait until the end of the week before I finalize the typed notes for discussing on Sunday. I did a first pass over the entire intro and lesson one yesterday. Today, I went over the intro and first section of the lesson; the scene, first section text, and *Your Turn* question 1. I had notes from last night and added more today. I may go over these parts tonight. No pressure. But this lesson has me processing some things. I want to prayerfully and carefully walk my way through this.

By the way, I did not do my laundry yesterday. So I did it today...LOL

## 3:55pm

My new Palma 2 arrived. As expected, it's about the same size as my iPhone. I went through the initial setup and already installed the Supernote Partner App and Gemini. I'll work on installing the other apps tonight. I think I'm going to like it. But I won't really know until I get some time with it. I'm looking forwarding to giving it a go!

I've already jumped in and added more notes for the Bible study. It seems I'm still processing what I read at lunch. I'm glad I'm handwriting the initial thoughts. It's easy to jot thoughts down on my Supernote Manta and then later revise things as text when I can dedicate the time to focus. I love this writing workflow I'm developing.

## 7:40pm

Tonight's walk was anything but relaxing...LOL I was so tense tonight. I felt a little stressed. It might be related to setting up apps on the new device. I probably should have taken my walk first...LOL But the walk ended very well. After I prayed about how tense I felt, that last lap was very peaceful. And the sunset was amazing. I wanted to end on a high note. So I went inside after that calm lap.

I'm thinking about writing the next part of our August vacation. Today might be a double header entry day.

I'm listening to *Greg Marine's Station* on Apple Music using the new device. It's like having an iPod Touch...LOL

## 9:35pm

I wrote part 5 of Our August Vacation. So today is officially a double header. Despite having poor sleep and that strange walk experience, today was a really good day. I'm glad to have written part 5 tonight. Reliving that amazing vacation is fun. It's making me excited for our next vacation in November.

I was looking at that camera again today. I'm close to pulling the trigger. I'm researching mounts to put it in my car. There is scenery I'd love to capture on some of my driving experiences.

Also, I may still post a view of the videos I made for my writing workflow here in my journal soon after all. Even though I couldn't make a full video I liked, there are still parts I want to share here. I've learned I just need to start somewhere and allow these things to grow into what I hope they'll become. Nothing starts the way we want. At least not in my experience...LOL
