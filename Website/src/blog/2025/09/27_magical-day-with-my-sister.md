# Magical Day with My Sister

I went to Walt Disney World with my sister today. It was a good day with a little *Disney Magic* thrown in. I started off by going to her house and delivering the blanket grandma made for her and her husband. I've had it since my last trip to Indiana...LOL That is part of the reason we were hanging out today. But we were both wanting a Disney day. So, that's what we decided to do for  *hanging out*. I may have mentioned that her pass expires this week. In the back of her mind, she was hoping to have one last Disney Day with her brother. She was happy that I suggested Disney for today...LOL

We arrived at the EPCOT parking lot just before 10am. We were planning to finish our day at EPCOT. So it made sense to park there. Our first park was going to be Magic Kingdom and they have a monorail from EPCOT to the Ticket and Transportation Center. The parking at EPCOT is so much better than at the TTC. Before we hopped on the monorail, I got my Joffrey's coffee...LOL I hadn't had any coffee for the day yet. I don't need the coffee. I just love the coffee...LOL I had the whole thing gone by the time we got to the TTC...LOL

From the TTC, we took the ferry over to Magic Kingdom. For both the monorail and the ferry, I did some POV video recording. I haven't looked at the footage to see how it turned out. But those were my first attempts of the day. There is a monorail from the TTC over to Magic Kingdom. But since we had already been on a monorail, I like to take the ferry across the lagoon. Once we got to Magic Kingdom, we did some PhotoPass photos with the Fall decorations in front of the Main Street Train station.

Once we were in the park, I recorded more POV video as we walked in and down part of main street. Again, I hope the footage turned out good...LOL We stopped off at Starbucks for her strawberry acai drink. That was when we realized just how busy the parks were today. At first I thought it was just the time of day. But it turned out the parks were very busy today. But that was okay. Next we got some photos around the castle to send to mom. And then made our way over to the circus area.

I had heard they had some new decorations for Dumbo. So that is why we went over there. I'm glad we did! I hadn't been in the circus area in a while. I got more POV video there. I took some photos of a few of the Fall decorations, including the new Dumbo things. We did some shopping in the circus tent gift shop. I was able to get some pins there. A few for myself and a few as gifts.

After that, we made our way over to It's a Small World. That's grandma's favorite. So we wanted to ride it for her. I took a POV video on the ride to see how that would work out. We took a few selfies there and other photos to send to her photo frame <3

The park was too busy to do any other rides. Before we left, I got something to eat from over by Tiana's. It was a hot-honey chicken bowl. It was very good and I'm glad I got it. After that, we went to the Emporium and I did more shopping. There I got my new mug and a magnet.

Then we made our way back to EPCOT. On the way, we took the ferry and then monorail. The reverse from before...LOL I took another POV from the ferry because I had a better view the second time.

At EPCOT, we ate a few of the festival foods. One of the things I had was the unnecessarily spicy wings like a do each year. This year's were so much hotter than previous years. I loved them. I also got my traditional pickle milkshake. It was amazing as always.

Before we left EPCOT and headed home, we decided to ride Figment's ride for our brother <3 That's his favorite character, and by extension, ride. There is a bathroom over by it and I wanted to use that bathroom there. My sister is known for knowing where every WDW is...LOL Well, she didn't know about this one...LOL She was excited to discover a new one...LOL So she had me take her photo in front of it so she could send it to mom and dad...LOL

I took another POV video on Figment. I hope it turns out. I'd like to send that one to my brother. We tried to take some selfies on it. It's a dark ride. So I'm not sure if those turned out yet. If they did, we'll send those to our brother too.

Before we left the park, we did some PhotoPass photos in front of Spaceship Earth. Then as we were leaving EPCOT, I got another Joffrey's coffee to have on the ride home as usual...LOL When we got back to her house, her husband was home from work and had picked up our dinner. It was great to have dinner with them and to hangout with her husband before I headed home.

Folks kept complimenting me on my attire today. I wore my F4NT4STIC 4 inspired retro outfit...LOL And of course, my Mickey Ears. Overall, it was a good day. But it was very hot. The temperature wasn't the worst part. The humidity was oppressively high today. So there was a little struggle with that. But everything else was well for the day and we made some great memories.

It was a *magical day with my sister* <3
