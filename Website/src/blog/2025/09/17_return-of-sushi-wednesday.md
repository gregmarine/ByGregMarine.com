# Return of Sushi Wednesday

## 8:55am

I slept really well last night. And I sort of slept in. The white noise ended around 7:45am. The first alarm went off at 8am with me tapping snooze. The second alarm went off at 8:09 am with another tap of the snooze button. And I finally woke at 8:17am. Apple Watch recorded 6 hours, 49 minutes of sleep.

## 11:35am

Today is going rather well. Most Wednesdays do. I had to speak in this week's team meeting. That went well. Once again, I enjoyed writing for Humpty Dumpty Day. This time, it wasn't an ordeal. He surfed off into the sunset to wish summer a goodbye.

I'm sorry to see summer end this weekend. But I'm happy to welcome Autumn. I've grown to love the seasons. Spring remains my favorite. But I appreciate them all now. Florida won't feel any different for a while. But the seasonal changes still make an impact on me.

I've gone back to having sushi on Wednesday. I was doing that towards the end of my time in Indiana. I continued it when I moved to Florida, I stopped around the time I was beginning my health journey, I think. Last week, I decided I wanted to bring that back. I'll try it for a while and see if I want to keep it. I'm doing the $5 sushi from Publix. A third-party makes it. Last week and today, I got 3 of those cheap rolls and I also got 1 $10 roll as an extra bonus roll. I eat 2 at lunch and 2 at dinner. The special one I have at dinner. These aren't the best rolls. But I get 4 for the price of 1 of the fancy ones from Zen...LOL And doing this has made my heart happy.

## 2:40pm

There was a quarterly department meeting today for all of IT. I'll admit, I sort of zone out in these meetings. I know the information is valuable. But it isn't to me. I don't usually get anything out of these meetings that pertains to my job. And there is rarely an actionable item I need to do as a result of such meetings. But it's part of the *job* and I go with a *smile* on my face...LOL Not a literal smile because we don't attend with our cameras on...LOL

My lunch sushi was good. I ate it during the meeting. That freed me up to do other things on my lunch break; which included some extra focused Bible study time. *Today's* has a lot of scripture references. So I had plenty of time to look those up and read them. I don't always do that because I often know the context. But I have decided I'm going to make more of an effort to go through scripture references even if I'm already familiar what the passages. It doesn't take anything away from my life to look those up. In fact, it adds to my life.

My nervous system took a jolt today. They were doing the lawn maintenance today. For some reason, half a dozen guys were running their blowers outside my apartment for an extended period all at the same time. It got to me and I took the opportunity to pray for those workers and tried not to allow it to impact me so much. It's the loud unpredictable sound and the proximity to my windows and door that trigger me. And they don't just go full throttle the whole time. They gun it...let off the gas...then gun it...let off the gas...over and over and over. They were still there as I left to get my sushi. When I returned home, a completely different set of guys were there doing the same thing. This ordeal took maybe an hour or so. I'm fine now, though. It's crazy how something like that can impact the nervous system.

## 4:25pm

As I've mentioned before, I've gone back and re-read my past journal entries. Each day, I read the one from last year if I wrote one on that day. I had forgotten about my private journal I was writing in 2023 before I got my journal going on the blog. Today, I read all of my 2023 entries up through yesterday's date. Back then, it was Cherie who inspired me to journal. Her blog begins in September that year. I started to re-read her past entries this month. Again, I just read the one from that day for each year if one is written. It doesn't take long to read all of these. Neither of us write every day. And we don't always write on the same days. It's interesting to see how we have grown. And interesting how some things haven't changed. Some of what I wrote about 2 years ago is still on my mind today. For example, I was ready to move 2 years ago...LOL And I was struggling with where to go to church as far back as then too.

Some things change. Some things stay the same. But I continue to grow.
I don't live in the past. And I'm not anchored to it. I'm just learning from it and building hope for the future. All the while enjoying the gift of the present <3

## 5:30pm

When I bought my new device, I got out my studio headphones to listen to music with it. I used to use these headphones to produce things like my podcast. They've been boxed up since I moved to Florida. It was good to pull them out yesterday and use them again. I love studio headphones for their high fidelity. Plus they are great at blocking out ambient noise from outside without all that noise canceling technology that impacts the fidelity of the music. After my mostly weekly experience earlier, I think I should use these headphones when the lawn service is here...LOL As long as I'm not in a meeting, I can listen to tunes in studio quality. I was able to configure my new device to continue playing music while the folio is closed and the device is locked. This feels just like when I had an iPod. I love this <3

## 8:10pm

Tonight's walk was very pleasant. Lot's of prayer, as usual. And I had a few interactions with neighbors. I also got to see a beautiful thing with the ducks. I don't know that they're ducklings anymore since they can fly now. But they still come when momma calls...LOL

My dinner sushi was good. I'll be back to cooking tomorrow.

I'll have my mostly weekly call with mom and dad tonight. It will be good to talk to them. Mom went back to work this week. She is doing so well. I'm looking forward to hearing the latest tonight.

## 10:20pm

Mom and dad are doing well. Mom is especially great. My heart is so happy after hearing the latest post-cancer update. She has a follow up tomorrow morning. That should go well considering how she feels. Assuming all remains on track, chemo should begin in 2 weeks. I'll be up for a visit the following weekend. My sister and her husband will be going up as well. Everyone in the family might actually all be together for a rare moment. Picture time...LOL Mom is hoping to get a new portrait of me on that visit. She had dad put together a special picture frame that has each of us in separate photos that are black and white with a purple mum. The mum is the only thing in color in each photo. Mine is still from before I lost all the weight and grew my hair back...LOL This collage of photos is in the guest room. The room has a grey and purple theme. So the collage goes well in there.

Today was a good day <3
