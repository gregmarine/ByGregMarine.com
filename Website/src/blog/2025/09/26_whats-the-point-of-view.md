# What's the Point-of-View

## 8:50am

I sometimes wonder if being a quiet neighbor gives my neighbors the impression that I can't hear them. Since they can't hear me, you know. Giving them the idea that they can be as loud as they want. But then again, perhaps I have a false sense of being quiet. Maybe I'm loud to them? LOL

Another night without white noise went really well. I slept great. The above
statement is unrelated...LOL

## 10:30am

I don't know...

The beginning of my journeys to seek knowledge and understanding have a starting point. The destination is always different. But I launch each knowledge journey by acknowledging that I don't know. I sometimes find it difficult to admit *that* with others because either they think I *should* know, or they *think* they *know* and I feel some shame in not knowing. What seems obvious to some may not be so obvious to me. And it's possible they are wrong anyway. Not everyone starts off with *I don't know*, you know. Some start off *knowing*
everything...LOL

## 12:40pm

I was asked if I could help a colleague earlier. I did my best...LOL They are trying to upgrade a library in one of the automation systems. I'm not too familiar with that system. But another set of eyes is what I could provide. And I asked questions they hadn't thought to ask themselves. I hope I was of some help at least. It's a good reminder that you don't have to know anything about a subject to still be helpful. And you don't always need an expert to find help from someone. All conversations can be helpful when we are open to listening. We can help each other find the blind spots we would each miss on our own.

## 2:30pm

I'm having one of those days when I think it's time for a career change. Is professional thinker a thing? I sure do think a lot...LOL I'm good at my job. And I do enjoy it mostly. I am just ready for change. Maybe in 5 years I can be doing something else. I have time to plan for that if I give myself 5 years. I'd actually love to go back to a hands on type job. What I do now is sort of hands on. But it isn't quite what I mean. I sit at a computer all day. I'd love to be away from the computer. I loved doing food service and that bookstore I once worked at.

## 3:50pm

I just discovered my studio headphones are breaking. I'll have to replace them. They are about 5 years old I think. But they were in storage most of that time. The storage was always inside an environmentally controlled space. Oh well. I'll shop for replacements soon. In the meantime, I still have wired earbuds I can use.

## 4:30pm

Good news! The part of my headphones that was breaking is replaceable. The ear cushions turned out to be the problem...LOL I've ordered new ear cushions and they should arrive Sunday.

Bad news! I'll not be observing Fish Friday after all...LOL The taters and trout will have to wait a few more weeks.

Good news! I'll be having tacos for dinner tonight instead. You know me and tacos. This will be my third time having tacos this week...LOL

Bad news! j/k No other bad news...LOL

Good news! My camera's tripod and POV lanyard arrived. So I'll get to try POV captures at Disney tomorrow. I was sad yesterday thinking I wouldn't be able to try that tomorrow when the shipment kept getting delayed. The delay is over. First world problem, I know. But sadness is a valid emotion. And I didn't let it ruin my week when I was uncertain. It was only a bummer. But no worries now since it all arrived today...LOL

I also got a few new string backpacks to try. One looks like it has a separate pocket large enough for my Supernote Nomad. It also has a side pocket for a water bottle. The main part is a regular string backpack, though.

## 5:20pm

I recently joined a Reddit community called r/writerDeck. It appears to be a group of people who create writing workflows with technology in a way that simulates vintage writing like typewriters and such. I just found someone who has the same setup as I do with a Supernote Manta and Qwerkywriter keyboard. It's a fun setup that makes me feel like I'm using a vintage typewriter. I was amazed that someone else out there has the same setup. I replied to their post about it. So fun!

## 8:20pm

I'm sure you're wondering...

Yes, the tacos were fantastic...LOL

Also, I took the POV camera on a little field trip for my evening walk. I'll try to include a little video at the end of this entry. I'm excited to try this at Disney tomorrow. I may try to mount it in my car tomorrow as well. Depending on how well it captures the ambiance, I may be able to make video journals quickly. That won't be the focus tomorrow, though. Tomorrow is mostly to try it out in a few scenarios and see how it works. My main focus will be enjoying time with my sister.

Each of the 4 parks has something new since my last visit. I think we'll only have time for Magic Kingdom and EPCOT. I hope to find a new mug, a pin to commemorate the day, and 1 set of mystery pins.

There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow, Shining at the End of Every Day <3
