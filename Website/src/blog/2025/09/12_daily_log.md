# Daily Log

## 9:10am

I've been trying a new daily log technique this week. I'm really enjoying the process. I'm not sure if much will come of logging my days. But it has helped me connect with each day. Part of the process has been to journal thoughts in a timestamp way. But so far, I haven't used those to compile a blog entry at the end of today. So I may try that today. I was inspired by Cherie's blog entry from 2 years ago. It was one of these timestamp entries. So I'm now thinking about creating an entry for today from my log. It was also the first time she mentioned me in her journal.

Speaking of Cherie, she sent me a heartwarming message last night to express her gratitude that I've been I part of her summer. She is having an amazing summer this year. I'm grateful to be on this journey with her. We each have our separate parts of our journeys. But we also have this special part together. I'm grateful to God for Blessing the both of us with each other. I love the memories we already share. I'm looking for to all of the memories yet to come. Hopefully I'll continue writing the remaining parts of our vacation soon...LOL

## 11:15am

I've missed the food trucks that used to come here to my apartment complex. They returned this summer. But so far, I haven't been home when they are here. That is not the case today. The Mis Empanadas food truck will be here tonight and I've already ordered my supper. I'll be having whatever their daily special is going to be and some Bacalaitos (cod fish fritters). The special, because I love to explore new things even if I don't know what to expect. The Bacalaitos because I wanted to observe Fish Friday...LOL

I haven't gone to Zen kitchen to Bar in quite a while. I haven't been to WDW in a while either. Perhaps I should do both soon. I miss them both. But at the same time, I haven't had the *itch* to go to either of those places lately. I need to go to the grocery this weekend. I haven't cooked at home all week. I miss that. I'm glad I have been eating out this week, though. I was missing that too. And I've tried new things as a result. Perhaps some of that will inspire me in the kitchen.

I'm content.

## 1:40pm

I ended up having fish at Olive Garden for lunch...LOL It's definitely fish Friday...LOL I don't really *love* Olive Garden. But I do like it. It is one of those *comfort food* places for me. It connects me to my childhood. Their salmon is pretty good. I also had the pasta Fagioli soup and breadsticks. I read and made some initial notes for today's devotional. I love the music they play here. That's another comfort for me. I got a take home entr√©e for lunch tomorrow. Their spaghetti with meat sauce and some breadsticks. I'll be going to the grocery in the afternoon tomorrow and needed something for lunch...LOL

## 2:45pm

In the wee hours of the morning, I was dreaming about making my morning coffee. Literally dreaming about my French Press goodness that produces the best bitter black nectar this side of heaven...LOL In the dream...crash! Glass everywhere! The beaker of my French Press shattered and woke me up. In shock, I sprang from my bed and leaped to the light switch across the room. In a panic, I stared at my bed as if the glass were all over it...LOL Alas, no glass. As my mind was becoming clearer, I looked down beside me to discover my pin board had fallen from the wall. The crash I heard in the dream was the pin board losing the fight against gravity in real life...LOL

The dream was so vivid. Before I noticed the pin board, my mind thought there was glass all over. The mind can be an interesting thing sometimes. The Command strip I used failed. I had concerns when I applied it. But I had forgotten since as it has been holding all week. I need to buy some new strips. I'm not sure the board is fixable. But I have another. I'm glad it didn't damage the pins. And I discovered a hidden Mickey on the back of one that's made of 3 cubic zirconia stones!

## 5:00pm

Earlier, I had an idea to make a video montage of my latest journal process. I may do that yet tonight and post it in today's entry. It would show going from writing by hand to the publish writing on any blog. That should be fun! Hopefully you'll see it below...LOL

At about this time a year ago, I was working a 9a - 6p work schedule due to my sleeping schedule. Lately, I've been back to a similar schedule for sleep and work. The late nights and mornings seem to work well for me overall. The slightly shifted work schedule seems to be working too. It hasn't made an impact at work. But everything outside of work has seen some positive impact again. I don't recall why I shifted back to a more normal east coast schedule when I did. But I seem to be getting closer to my ideal schedule again.

I bought a vintage typewriter style keyboard to use with my Supernote tablets for when I'm typing. It gives me that classic typewriter feel that I enjoyed when I first learned to type. I learned on a real typewriter in the mid-90s. Up until this new device, I hadn't ever written with a typewriter. I've always used some sort of word processor. I only used a typewriter to learn to type. This gives me those vibes I love when writing. I feel more connected to the words. Sort of like how I feel when I'm handwriting. The mechanical keys have a tactile feel that modern keyboards lack, in my opinion. So far, I've only used this new vintage typewriter keyboard for my writing. It would work for my job too. But I like that I only use it for my writing. The back of it has a slot that holds my tablet. So it feels like I'm typing on *paper* in a way. The tablet is e- ink. So it is easy on the eyes too. It's only *paper-like*, though. It isn't exact...LOL People say the Supernote feels like writing on real paper. I disagree. It feels pretty good. But it still feels like I'm writing on a screen...LOL Don't get me wrong...I still love it! And this *typewriter* feels pretty good even though it isn't exactly like typing on paper.

## 10:25pm

I've had a good day today. I've enjoyed journaling today with the goal of doing a timestamp entry. I was reading my entry from a year ago and saw that I did a timestamp entry that day too. That day was so different from today...LOL I went to Magic Kingdom after work that day. I wanted a hotdog from Casey's...LOL I also rode a few attractions and took in some of the ambience. But the main goal was that hotdog...LOL

I'm working on that video montage during this segment and will post it at the end.

I didn't enjoy my dinner. That's okay, though. I'm looking forward to being back in my kitchen this coming week. I'm glad I've been eating out for a bit. I realized this is the most time I've spent at home since July. I traveled 3 times in August. I've been home now for 10 days. This weekend marks the most consecutive days at home since July...LOL

Well, I better wrap this up. I still need to export these notes, revise them on my *typewriter* and post it. Plus video record the remaining processes, edit the video, and post that on YouTube before linking it here...LOL

I left in the parts about posting the video montage. But I decided to save that for another day. It's getting late and I wanted to be sure the video was good enough to demonstrate my process. I don't want to throw it together half baked...LOL
