# Goodbye Summer, Hello Fall

## 12:15pm

It has been a good day so far.

I forgot to wear my Apple Watch to bed again. And once again, I noticed it when I got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. No snooze button again today. But I did sleep longer than yesterday. I woke up before my adjusted alarm.

I went to Publix to pick up some donuts for a cheat treat. I tried to be home before church. I did get home before 9am, but then realized church was going to be a combined service at 11am today. So I went back over my Bible study notes while having breakfast.

I forgot to mention last night that my sister and I finalized plans to go to Disney on Saturday. We'll park at EPCOT and ride the monorail over to Magic Kingdom. We'll go back to finish our time there at EPCOT. We'll get back to her place in time for me to see her husband when he gets off work.

Today's sermon inspired some things for me to pray about. These things feel related to this week's Bible study as well.

## 1:05pm

I'm having a peaceful day. It feels like *shalom* peace. It's difficult to describe or explain. It's one of those things one needs to experience to understand it, perhaps. But perhaps I don't fully understand what I'm experiencing myself?

I'm having lunch at Culver's again. Has it become a Sunday tradition? I usually get a spicy chicken in honor of my son. Today, I went with a pork tenderloin in honor of mom. I got strawberry topping for my frozen custard in honor of my late great grandmother

I'll be getting a carwash and going to the grocery next.

## 2:55pm

The carwash and grocery trip were a sorceress...LOL

At the grocery, I experienced something that happens to me from time to time. I was asked a question and the words of my answer came out in the wrong order...LOL I had to start over. This happens most often when I'm writing; whether it be by hand or typing. I'll begin to write words that come later in the sentence, or even the next sentence, before the words I'm supposed to be writing. On occasion, I'll even be in the middle of a word and will start to write the next word as if smashing words together. I see it as my brain is operating faster than I can write. That's how it felt at the grocery. My brain felt faster than my mouth could speak...LOL

I lost that moment of *shalom* peace I had earlier. I'm okay, I just came back to earth a bit...LOL I often feel this tug-of-war between being *in* this world while not being *of* it. But I feel really good today. And the best is yet to come <3

## 8:30pm

Well, *shalom* returned to my heart. Cherie and I had our fellowship time today and I felt the same peace I had felt earlier today. During our call, I realized what might have been going on today with that. In the moments I felt *shalom*, I was focused on God. When I wasn't feeling it, I was focused on *my* understanding of what I was doing. The thing I need to deny myself most is *my* understanding. That will help me follow Jesus <3

My sister and her husband are at a Red Sox vs. Rays game tonight. It's official! All 3 of us went to a MLB baseball game in the same season. My brother went in July. I went in August. And now my sister in September. Pretty cool!

I did more work on my Supernote Bible project today. I plan to do more of it here in a little bit too. I'm currently working through Psalms. That's the most time consuming one. So it's all down hill after I'm finished with that one. Perhaps I'll complete the project this week.

## 10:05pm

I was able to finish Psalms. I have now done the 4 Gospels, James, Hebrews, and Psalms. That's a pretty good start to motivate me to move forward with this project. But I'm finished working on projects today.

I've enjoyed doing these timestamp entries. Jotting down thoughts by hand and then compiling them into a blog post has been helpful lately. It's part of a larger effort to log my day. I've been tracking some things, making notes, prayer journaling, and timestamp journaling in a new *notebook* each day. I'm going to continue this practice for a while and see how it evolves. I may not make a blog post daily. But the daily log notes are a good thing for me.

The End...

...of summer.

Goodbye Summer, Hello Fall!
