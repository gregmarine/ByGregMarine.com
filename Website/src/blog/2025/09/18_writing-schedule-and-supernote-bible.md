# Writing, Schedule, and Supernote Bible

## Morning

I slept really well last night. I had several dreams. But nothing I could remember well enough to dream journal about. I forgot to put my Apple Watch on before bed. I realized it when I got up to go to the bathroom. So I put it on then. That was a little over an hour before I got up for the day. Which means I didn't track my sleep last night. I'm actually considering an end to tracking my sleep that way. Now that I journal all the time, I could just *track* things this way. Instead of technical data, I could keep track of things in a more personal way. That may help me connect to my sleep better. I could continue collecting the watch data and just not check it daily.

Like yesterday, I hit the snooze twice. I rarely do that. It's been nice to sleep a little longer. I have been slowly getting up lately. My mornings have been so calm. I start work a little later. But that just means I work a little later too. I tried this same thing about a year ago. It works well with my late sleep schedule. Which, again, affords me a more productive routine. This feels more natural to me.

I've been thinking a lot about my writings. These past few years have been quite inspiring. And now that I'm doing so much handwriting, words have been flowing constantly. I think I'd like to get that part of my website going again. My old website had some of my writings. I have a lot of stuff in *draft mode* right now. But I could put it all out there and update it as I go. Sort of like writing in public. Once something is officially published, I could transition the content. But I'm not sure just yet. I'm simply thinking about this. I could put up a gatekeeper and give access to those I trust so they can watch as my writings come together. Basically a password protected section. Or I could keep privately sending PDFs of my work in progress as I have done before.

I got to thinking more about this last night after my call with mom and dad. I got to talking about how much more writing I've done since May after I started using digital notebooks. I've got over a gigabyte of handwritten and sketched data since I started in May. At this rate, I'll average 3-4 gigabytes of data annually. I'm starting to become more organized and want to do more with what I've written. I hope something comes of this.

## Afternoon

Our Bible studies and devotionals have typically been timely for the circumstances in our lives. Our journeys, both separate and together, have been Blessed by this. The introduction and first lesson of our current study is a Godsend. I needed this in my current season of life. It's bringing up questions I needed to ask myself and find the answers to. The discussion through our fellowship will be quite helpful too. I'm really connecting with this week's lesson <3

With my shifted schedule, I've been eating my meals at a shifted routine too. This week, that has been helpful because I've had meetings during the traditional lunch hour. With the main office being in Central time, this happens every so often. Some folks schedule meetings for just before *their* lunch hour...LOL I assuming this, of course. In some cases, they may need to do that because key people may only have  *lunch hour* available for such meetings. And some people may simply not care or respect other's schedules...LOL But the shift in my schedule has helped quite a bit for me this week.

I was reminded that today is my half birthday, as calculated by the number of days in 6 months. By the day of the month, my half birthday is Saturday. My firth day is March 12. I was born 8 days late...LOL Before last year, I didn't pay any mind to these things. I'm glad I do now, though. It's fun!

## Evening

My walk tonight was quite pleasant once again. I was able to enjoy the sunset. The duck babies came in for a landing at the perfect moment. I got a double fist bump from my little buddy. And the prayer time was amazing.

On Saturday, I began a project to build a PDF, or PDFs, of the Bible to reference on my Supernotes. Long story short, I couldn't find a PDF or epub of the Bible that works well enough on those devices for my purposes. So I set out to create one. I found *1000* ways not to do it...LOL On Sunday, I figured out a possible solution. The *solution* was going to be time consuming. But I felt it was worth it. I've slept on it since Sunday and picked back up on the idea tonight. I worked with the 4 Gospels to test out the idea and I feel it was a success. Indeed, it will be a time consuming process. But, again, well worth the effort for why I'm doing it. This will make it easy to link to Bible passages from notes. And it makes it possible to insert passages directly into notes. Plus it will work well with the Supernote Digest feature. I can use Digests for Bible studies and personal commentary. I'm using the Berean Standard Bible for this work. The BSB translation is in the Public Domain. Which means I can freely share this version for others to use as well when I'm finished creating it.

Today was a good day for me. My heart is happy <3
