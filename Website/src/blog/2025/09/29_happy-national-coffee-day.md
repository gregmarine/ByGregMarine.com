# Happy National Coffee Day

## 9:15am

It continues to be interesting to read past journal entries. I'm seeing some *patterns* emerging I hadn't really thought about. For example, even 2 years ago I was writing about where I should live and where I should go to church. The feelings popped up at about this time for the third year in a row in September. I wonder what it is about this time of the year?

2 years ago, I was journaling some reflections from a devotional I was doing at the time. I'm glad I wrote those down. Or typed them, I mean. It was good to see that again and shows me the importance of my journal and how it has impacted my journey these past 2 years. It further encourages me to write as much as I'm able. Even the private notes, like from 2 years ago before my blog, are very important. I've recently started to journal some privately again. Including prayer journaling. It'll be nice to look back on these things in the future.

I love my newest coffee mug <3

Happy National Coffee Day... LOL

## 9:50am

I'm about to have my weekly 1:1 with my boss. I never really know how those will go each week. They are rarely formal, though. Some weeks we don't even discuss work... LOL I think I'll ask about my self-eval. We may talk about the weekend. There isn't much going on this coming week. I'll probably talk about that issue I resolved and get approval to get it pushed to production. I doubt he'll have anything new for me. But we'll see. Perhaps my next timestamp will be about the meeting...LOL

I'm feeling drained. My allergies are acting up. It started last week I think. I dealt with an extreme reaction at EPCOT on Saturday. I forgot to mention it in my entry that day. Some sort of stage smoke triggered my eyes to become useless...LOL Once I left the area, it cleaned up and I was fine.

Time for the meeting!

## 10:35am

The boss was late...LOL But that's okay. It was a good meeting. We talked about the weekend. I told him about how one of the Cast asked my sister if I was her dad...LOL That's something else I forgot to mention in my entry the other day. I explained to my boss that my sister looks like she's in her twenties. I then mentioned how Cherie looks much younger too. That got use on a tangent about generations. We eventually circled back to talking about work...LOL He *approved* my solution to that issue. There is still something I need to double check before I submit the change for approval by the change approval board. If all goes well, it will be in production next week. Other than that, it's business as usual this week. Except I don't work Friday.

Dad started a group text this morning for National Coffee Day with some of us...LOL I sent my coffee selfie. My brother-in-law sent a photo too. My sister said Yuck... LOL we haven't heard from my brother yet. And I'm sure mom is just enjoying the texts...LOL

## 1:20pm

I needed to book a hotel for this weekend since mom and dad only have the one guestroom right now. And since I'll have Malachi, my grandma's house isn't an option either. She only has the one guestroom and her couch isn't *sleep-able*. I don't mind sleeping on the floor. But I thought it would be fun for Malachi and I to have a hotel. I love hotels and would actually prefer that on my visits up there. My new preferred hotel doesn't have a location near my hometown. There is a nice hotel in town there. I went to their website and it errored out when I tried to book. So I did the old fashioned thing and called to book. They immediately told me I needed to book online...LOL I explained the error and so they tried to book me over the phone. After about 10 minutes, it turns out they don't have any 2 bed rooms available this weekend anyway. That wasn't the error on the website, though. I couldn't even get to the booking page...LOL I shopped around for other hotels in the area. The prices are a bit high for that area. I wonder if an event is going on this weekend? I landed on a cute hotel with studio rooms and found one with 2 beds for a good price. It has a high rating and I feel good about.

## 2:25pm

My Supernote Bible project is coming along quite nicely. I have 45 books ready out of the 66 in the Bible. We aren't doing a Bible study this week due to my travels this weekend. So I plan to finish working on this project with the *extra* time I have this week. I may even have some time to explore some of the new ideas I have with the resources I now have as a byproduct of the process I developed for my original Bible project.

We started doing the Bible studies about a year ago. Up to that point, we did the devotionals. We are now in the fifth Bible study. Over the past 18 months, we have completed six devotionals and four Bible studies. We are on week three of eight with the current study. We have taken breaks as needed like we are this week. We didn't do that in the beginning. But we found breaks to be necessary for a few reasons. And I'm glad we do. We don't want to burnout. This fellowship has been a Blessed part of our friendship. I love that we have this. Thank You, Father <3 And thank you, Cherie <3 Okay, okay...yes, thank you too, Bingford...LOL

## 7:15pm

I took a *long* walk tonight. I got out earlier than usual. So I had more time before the sunset. I walked a total of 10 laps, I believe. That's about 3.25 miles. I was able to see a beautiful sunset. I wasn't sure I'd even be able to take a walk. And the skies were mostly overcast today. But I was able to take a walk after all and the sky opened up its veil.

My brother sent a selfie to our morning group text of him and my niece having coffee at Starbucks. The cups had my sister-in-law's name on it. I joked by saying *neither of these are coffee and neither of you are Amy*...LOL Both of their coffees were those fancy *not* coffee drinks that Starbucks has...LOL I was just kidding, of course, and said as much. Mom also replied to tell us how she loved seeing her family because of coffee day. She ask where oj day is...LOL Orange juice is her morning beverage of choice. I looked it up...It's May 4th...LOL Star Wars Day, my move-in anniversary here in Florida, and now OJ Day <3

## 9:30pm

I was able to talk to Malachi tonight <3 He's doing well right now.

The reason for the call, though, is that he needs a ride somewhere on Thursday and we needed to get him setup with Lyft. There's an option for me to get a ride for him through the system. But what we are trying first is him using it himself. I'm on *standby* in case he needs help Thursday. In the meantime, I've funded an *account* for him to use with the Lyft service. I think it will work well for him and it's a positive step for him.

## 10:00pm

I don't generally enjoy being in group texts. Even if I like everyone in the group...LOL I think you can mute those on iPhone now, maybe? But today's coffee group text that dad started has been fun. Everyone participated in some way. The jokes were fun and it was an interesting way for the family to create a shared experience <3

## 10:35pm

I was able to complete 2 more books of the Bible for my project. I wish I could have done more. But, as I said earlier, I'm drained today. So I'm going to go to bed earlier tonight. It still won't be early...LOL But *earlier* is still a good idea today.

## 10:50pm

The group text just *blew up* with everyone expressing gratitude for the fun today and everyone expressed love as well. My heart is happy <3

"Good night, John-boy"

"Good night Jim-Bob"
