## 07:25am

Yesterday, I started a timestamp journal. I made two segments and never got back to it...LOL It was a good day. I was just too occupied to keep up with the timestamps yesterday. And by the time my day came to an end, there wasn't enough time left to turn it into anything I would post. I may copy over some of the content over to today and leave out the stuff that was specific to yesterday and is no longer relevant today...hehehe

I've been working through this new sleep schedule. I'm learning its value. Especially yesterday and today. I woke around 6am and was up and about by 6:30am yesterday. Today, I was up and at 'em at 6:30 again. By 7:25 yesterday, I had already read through this week's Bible study lesson and was about to make my coffee and toast. Today, I've already done today's session of the Bible study and will be making coffee and toast soon again. I love starting my morning off this way. This is basically what it is like for me on the weekends, since I don't work those days. But being able to have this on a week day, before work, is a welcome change back to the way things were before I shifted my schedule last June.

I enjoyed that schedule for what it was to me. It began as a means to prepare for my first trip to California. I then embraced my natural night owl rhythm. But at the beginning of this year, I began to sense that it might be time to change back to a more normal schedule. That made me sad for a time. But mornings like these encourage me. These aren't the first mornings like this for me, actually. I had a few of these last week as well. It was a bit rough when I first started to change to this schedule. But it is balancing out well now.

I've officially been a Florida resident for 3 years now. My move-in anniversary was Sunday (5/4). Star Wars fandom celebrates it has Star Wars day (*May the Fourth be with You*). I do acknowledge that occasion too. But the date has more meaning to me as it's when I got the keys to my apartment.

In my journal last year, that was the day I last went out on the water. I took my (then) new paddle board out for her maiden voyage. I haven't been out on the water since. A photo I took that day still adorns my *Relax* wall hanging in my bathroom...hehehe I've thought about updating the photo on that thing. Being out on the water has become a thing of the past for me. I miss it. But it obviously isn't something I find importance or value in any longer.

A lot as changed about what I love to do here in Florida. The sun, the palm trees, the wildlife, and Disney are still very much a piece of my presence here. Things like exploring, going out on the water, or going to the beach are far less important now. I sometimes feel like going out to explore again. Maybe *someday*.

I still love living in Florida. And I finally do like living in my apartment. I signed for another year, after all...LOL But I still have that nagging feeling that my time here (my apartment) is coming to an end soon. Just the other day, I got that itch to move closer to Disney again...LOL

On my Florida anniversary, I did briefly go to Disney...hehehe The previous weekend, I had purchased 6 new mugs while I was vacationing with my parents. I started using them for the first time on Sunday. Well, the one I chose that day turned out to have a crack in it. I didn't notice it at first. I was taking communion and when I took that sip, some of it dripped on me. I thought I had just missed my mouth...LOL When I later picked up the mug for another sip, I noticed there was coffee on the coaster. I thought that was very odd. So, I poured the coffee into another of my new mugs. That's when I saw a dark line on the inside of the broken mug. Sure enough, the crack went from the inside out. But I hadn't noticed it when I cleaned the mug before using it. The darkness of the coffee is what revealed the crack. (Seems like there is a lesson in that statement...LOL More to come on that thought, perhaps?)

After church, I decided to head on back to Disney so I could exchange it. They rotate merchandise so frequently there, I didn't want to miss an opportunity to get a replacement of the same mug. I really like it...hehehe After exchanging the mug, I had lunch there and then went home. I went to Disney's Pop Century resort since that is where I bought the mugs. The food was okay-ish...LOL But the experience of being able to take a drive on such a lovely day to a magical place was amazing. That day's featured photo came from that experience.

On my drive home, I thought about how nice it would be live closer. I could pop in like that more often and do random things. Considering how little I do at the gulf, it makes more sense for me to live closer to something I actual do find important and put value in...LOL But I don't mind the drive, actually. One nice thing about living a little ways away, though, is how much time I have to pray while I drive. I do enjoy that very much.

I was just thinking about how amazing our Bible study has been. Between the devotionals and the study, we've been working through it for over a year. The current book will be done in mid-June. The next devotional comes out in July and the study in August. We'll have a few weeks in between the current book and the next devotional's arrival. It would be the first break since we stared all of this on March 17th, 2024 with the devotional we did from my (then) pastor at theChapel. Should we take a break? Or should we do *something* for those few weeks? I'm praying about it.

But that also reveals that we will be finished with the available *The Chosen* materials we've been working through sometime in October. The next season is filming now. Which means it won't be released until earliest next year sometime. It could be the end of the next year before season 6th's devotional and Bible study are available. So, what's next for this fellowship once we are caught up in October? Again, I'm praying about it.

It has been quite the journey through all of this. The momentum is good. What God is revealing to us has been amazing. Our calls on Sunday are the highlight of the week. What began as your average friendship and biweekly video calls became a daily and weekly fellowship that has taken us both into a deeper relationship with God. The only expectation I feel is waiting for what God plans to do next. And that is exciting!

We began as Disney friends on Twitter. She has since become a cherished and deer friend. Above anything else that stands out about our relationship, she is my sister in Christ. Everything else does, indeed, matter. But our connection through Jesus is the most important. He is Who created our true friendship <3

The anniversary of our true friendship beginning is coming up soon ðŸ¤­

I've been using a Brita water filter system since I loved here. The water isn't that great around here. I have had this system for 3 years now and had planned to replace it this year. Silly me thought *filtered* water was a good thing. Well, Brita isn't much of a filter system. I didn't know...hehehe I'm not sure if it was their marketing or simply my ignorance. But I was wrong about them. As the time approached to look into a replacement, I decided to approach this the way I have with other things this past year. I started with a question: *Is what I've always thought about this correct?*

I did some research and found that products like Brita and Pur really only take care of the things that create a certain smell or oder in water. The bad stuff is still there. After feeling a little like an idiot, I looked into what is a good filtration system for someone who lives in a apartment and doesn't really have control over the water flowing through their home. My current system is a large tank of water that I sit on my counter. It has a nice spout like one of those water coolers you see at the office or a sporting event...hehehe I wanted to find something similar, but something that actually removes most or all of the bad stuff, unlike Brita...HAHAHA

I found a nice reverse osmosis system I was considering. It was very pricey and requires electricity. It also isn't very big. The water fills up a pitcher. I may eventually move to that sort of system. But I also found a nice filtration option with a counter top tank similar to my current one that Culligan makes. It is a more advanced filter that takes care of all that junk found in water...including *forever* chemicals and pharmaceuticals. It's different than reverse osmosis but seems to be just as effective.

Nothing is going to be perfect. But this should be far better than that Brita. And I like that it is a similar tank to what I have now with a spout and large capacity. I use a lot of water and fill up my current tank a few times a day. Those pitchers aren't large enough. And I don't like the idea of using bottled water due to all the waste. I have considered finding some sort of recycling center even if it is a drive away. But that's still not ideal because of just how much water I use for drinking, making coffee, and cooking. I use filtered water for everything except showering, washing my hands, and cleaning dishes. But anything that is a part of something I'll ingest goes through a filter.
