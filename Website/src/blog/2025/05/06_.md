# TBD

## 07:25am

Yesterday, I started a timestamp journal. I made two segments and never got back to it...LOL It was a good day. I was just too occupied to keep up with the timestamps yesterday. And by the time my day came to an end, there wasn't enough time left to turn it into anything I would post. I may copy over some of the content over to today and leave out the stuff that was specific to yesterday and is no longer relevant today...hehehe

I've been working through this new sleep schedule. I'm learning its value. Especially yesterday and today. I woke around 6am and was up and about by 6:30am yesterday. Today, I was up and at 'em at 6:30 again. By 7:25 yesterday, I had already read through this week's Bible study lesson and was about to make my coffee and toast. Today, I've already done today's session of the Bible study and will be making coffee and toast soon again. I love starting my morning off this way. This is basically what it is like for me on the weekends, since I don't work those days. But being able to have this on a week day, before work, is a welcome change back to the way things were before I shifted my schedule last June.

I enjoyed that schedule for what it was to me. It began as a means to prepare for my first trip to California. I then embraced my natural night owl rhythm. But at the beginning of this year, I began to sense that it might be time to change back to a more normal schedule. That made me sad for a time. But mornings like these encourage me. These aren't the first mornings like this for me, actually. I had a few of these last week as well. It was a bit rough when I first started to change to this schedule. But it is balancing out well now.
