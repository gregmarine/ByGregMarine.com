# TBD

You may have noticed I haven't been including the featured photo and Bible in a Year reading in my posts lately. Well, I stopped adding them to my website for now...LOL I still take the photos and I'm on track with my daily readings. I just haven't felt like adding them as content for my website lately. It takes some time to do that. It was adding unnecessary stress to the little time I have to write. What I may start doing is batching that up for the week on weekends when I have more time. For now, I'm not going to be consistent with that on my website. I'll get around to it if it is important enough to me...hehehe

I also haven't been posting as often lately. I've been running out of time. And I haven't been doing timestamp entries. I have been keeping a list of topics I'd like to write about. And that list keeps getting longer. I'll have to break that up into multiple posts. I have written some of it out. But like before, not all of it is ready to be published. I intended to get around to some of that writing today. But that didn't happen.

I'm actually only posted this brief one to acknowledge the circumstances. A year from now, and beyond, I want to have this as a reminder that sometimes things don't go quite as expected. And I needed the further reminder that these times are okay. There isn't anything wrong when things don't work out. It doesn't always feel okay. Even now, I don't like that I haven't been able to complete much of my writing...LOL But it's oookkkaaayyy...HAHAHA

Today was a busy day. We are quickly approaching the *Big Bang*; which is this weekend. I was in a meeting this morning where some folks seemed really stressed about everything. Today was the official go/no go deadline. I'll find out tomorrow if we are officially a *go*. The meeting was at the end of business and I'm one to *clock out* as close to 5pm as possible. I was 15 minutes past 5 today, by the way...LOL
