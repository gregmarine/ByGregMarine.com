## Morning

Today is Malachi's big day...hehehe Today, he turns 20. I still vividly remember the moment I first saw him. I was present in the delivery room as I coached his mother through labor. And I was blessed to give him his first diaper. His poor mother was exhausted from a very long day of labor. And I imagine his poor little body was in shock at the day he had too...hehehe I was tired. But I didn't go through any of what those two went through that day. I did what I could to help them both get through their experience. I feel blessed to be a witness.

Life can be very complicated. But that first breath isn't so much. It's a deep breath, followed by the first cry...hehehe It's like, *what did I just go through?!?* All which happens after that is a series of moments that make up what we call life. The complexities come as we go through all of the other experiences that follow that first breath. He has now had 20 years of experiences. Some have been amazing through his eyes. Some have been a struggle. I'm so glad to be his father. I'm equally glad to see life through his eyes as he shares his hopes, struggles, and overall thoughts.
