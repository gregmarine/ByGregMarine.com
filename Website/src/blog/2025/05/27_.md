# TBD

## Morning

It's been a bit since I last sat down to write in this journal. Everything has been going quite well. But I haven't made the time to stop and write about anything...hehehe That's okay. I've been *good* busy.

*Big Bang* week was pretty successful. There were some issues throughout the week. Nothing directly related to me and the work I've been doing. But that means I was there to help others get through the week. I enjoyed that. I was able to meet all sorts of new people. There were times when I felt like a project manager instead of a software engineer. I definitely loved doing all that I did throughout the week. It makes me wonder if I'd like to venture down the project manager tract instead of completely leaving the industry. It's something to consider as I continue to question my career's future...hehehe

Today is the first work day of the week. It was nice having a 3 day weekend. This is also the first post-Big Bang business day. I imagine there will be some residual fallout from last week to deal with today. And tomorrow I'll be working an abbreviated day. After that, I'll be off to Indiana for Malachi's birthday and graduation. So, I'm not really stressing the thought of work this week...LOL

In an effort to get back to journaling, I'm adopting this 3 section approach Cherie introduced me to. *Morning, Afternoon, Evening*. I'm writing this section before work. Assuming I took a full lunch break today, I'll write another section then. And tonight, I'll wrap up the day with a third section.

I'm so happy to be sticking with this journal. I remember when I started this at the beginning of 2024. I had wished I had journaled throughout 2023. A lot happened that year that I would love to look back upon. In 2024, I started writing and I've enjoyed looking back. I may talk about this a bit more later, but I've started the process of turning my 2024 journal entries into a book. I've already written the introduction and first chapter. I started the intro a few weeks ago and refined it more this past weekend. I did the first chapter this past weekend as well. I love how it is starting off. I hope to see this book through to completion. Lord willing, it will all work out :)

I'm looking forward to seeing Malachi this week. I've missed him. I was so happy to get to talk to him on Friday. God Blessed us with a phone call <3
