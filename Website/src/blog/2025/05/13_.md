I think *the* most valuable class I took in school was typing...LOL I sort of took it out of a need for that *one last class* on my schedule. Little did I know just how valuable this skill would become over the span of the years that followed. I did really well in the class for the first half. But the second half, I slowly declined in my grade. That's because I hit a point where I simply could not type any faster. The problem I ran into was that the exercises were based on reading something and typing it out. I reached the maximum speed at which I can read...LOL When I'm typing from thought, like how I write this journal, I can type mmmuuuccchhh faster...HAHAHA

I have trouble with reading quickly. I tend to re-read a lot of what I just read because I want to understand what I'm reading. I wouldn't call that a bad habit really. But it has caused me some trouble over the years. I'm hoping to get better at that by reading a variety of different things. I've mostly read technical articles for my field or news to stay up on world events. I've had those seasons when I would read some fiction works. And I read the occasional non-fiction as well. Now that I have a Kindle, I'm hoping to read more often. Will this help my reading speed? Probably not...LOL But it will at least help my mind, I'm sure.

I may have mentioned that reading was once used as a disciplinary tool to get me to do my homework. I don't blame my dad for trying that. And it's my own fault for not getting over that for years...LOL It wasn't until recently when I started to love reading again. And I'm pretty excited that I'm enjoying it now. After all, I love to write...LOL How can I be a writer if I don't like reading?!? HAHAHA

I originally planned to make my next trip to Indiana a 2 week visit. I was going to drive up the weekend of Memorial Day and spend the last week of May through the first week of June up there. I have since settle in on a brief 3 day visit. I'll be flying up the day before my son's birthday and will fly home a few days later. I may try to give a longer trip a try in the summer. But for now, I'll just be going up for his birthday and graduation.
