# Joy Comes in the Mourning Coffee

*Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the [mourning]. You turned my mourning into [coffee];* ~ Psalm 30:5b,11a (paraphrased by *meeeeeee*)

Today is my annual celebration of life for my late paternal grandfather. He left this age and entered into the next on this day in 2019. As I've mentioned before, I wasn't able to mourn his death from 2019 through 2021 on this day. But since 2022, I've been able to mourn in the ways that work best for me for my relationship with him.

I'm grateful for the life that was grandpa. He is an amazing man. I find joy in how I've mourned him these last few years. And God has turned my mourning into coffee...LOL After all, remembering grandpa was why I started drinking coffee in the first place...LOL Today's dose is just extra special...hehehe

Grandpa Bob was a good man. He cared very much for family. From my perspective, I don't think he ever thought about himself. He had his hobbies and had a study. But those were just things he did and place to go when he needed that sort of thing. Most of the time, he was doing *something* for someone else.

He served in the US Navy for about 4 years, I believe. With our last night, I'm sure that was *fun* being in the *Navy*...HAHAHA He was stationed in southern California near where I like to visit. I think the base is in LA County, actually...possibly Orange County. But he and grandma lived in Orange County. A stones throw from where Disneyland was building built. My dad and first uncle were born there. My second uncle was born in Indiana after they returned home.

Grandpa and grandma didn't want to raise children in the faster paced culture of California. So, that's why they returned to Indiana to spend the rest of their lives. They traveled along historic Route 66...hehehe This was back before the interstate system was put into place. I've been on parts of Route 66 in Illinois myself and I've been to Santa Monica Pier. I love the connection I've felt between those experiences and my grandparents.

When I went to the pier last year, I sent photos to grandma. She told me of how her and grandpa danced to the live music of Lawrence Welk on the Santa Monica Pier. To be standing in the very place they danced 70+ years prior brought me so much joy. I hadn't ever heard that story before that day. I'm grateful God brought me to that place in the moment and inspired grandma to share the story.

One of grandpa's hobbies was woodworking. He made all sorts of things for us. He would also do art with it. He'd burn outlines of images on the wood and then paint them. I don't have all of those things any longer. But I do have a few that I cherish. When I was young, I didn't have the same appreciation I have now. But I'm glad I didn't loose everything from my youth and can still hold on to memories today; whether only memories or some physical items too.

Grandpa also loved fishing. He and grandma lived on a lake for a while. I remember several times going fishing with grandpa. Sometimes we didn't catch anything. But just being with him was what mattered. And the stories he would tell would keep my interest even when the fish found not interest in our bait...LOL

The lake's name was Heritage. It was a fitting name for what memories I have with my grandpa there. He passed on a lasting heritage of God's Love. There's a community near where I live today that is also called Heritage Lake. I smile every single time I drive by; which is weekly. It's between my home and my grocery...hehehe





Grandpa always drank that cheap Foldgers instant coffee. I don't care much for it. I still endure it when I visit with grandma since she still drinks it...LOL I'm more of high quality coffee person. I drink Joffrey's. But the connection to grandpa isn't the brand. It's warmth I feel as I sip that bitter black nectar. I mourn grandpa. I love grandpa. But joy truly does come in the mourning coffee.
