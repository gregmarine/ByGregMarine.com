# Joy Comes in the Mourning Coffee

*Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the [mourning]. You turned my mourning into [coffee];* ~ Psalm 30:5b,11a (paraphrased by *meeeeeee*)

Today is my annual celebration of life for my late paternal grandfather. He left this age and entered into the next on this day in 2019. As I've mentioned before, I wasn't able to mourn his death from 2019 through 2021 on this day. But since 2022, I've been able to mourn in the ways that work best for me for my relationship with him.

I'm grateful for the life that was grandpa. He is an amazing man. I find joy in how I've mourned him these last few years. And God has turned my mourning into coffee...LOL After all, remembering grandpa was why I started drinking coffee in the first place...LOL Today's dose is just extra special...hehehe

Grandpa Bob was a good man. He cared very much for family. From my perspective, I don't think he ever thought about himself. He had his hobbies and had a study. But those were just things he did and place to go when he needed that sort of thing. Most of the time, he was doing *something* for someone else.

He served in the US Navy for about 4 years, I believe. With our last night, I'm sure that was *fun* being in the *Navy*...HAHAHA He was stationed in southern California near where I like to visit. I think the base is in LA County, actually...possibly Orange County. But he and grandma lived in Orange County. A stones throw from where Disneyland was building built. My dad and first uncle were born there. My second uncle was born in Indiana after they returned home.

Grandpa and grandma didn't want to raise children in the faster paced culture of California. So, that's why they returned to Indiana to spend the rest of their lives. They traveled along historic Route 66...hehehe This was back before the interstate system was put into place. I've been on parts of Route 66 in Illinois myself and I've been to Santa Monica Pier. I love the connection I've felt between those experiences and my grandparents.

When I went to the pier last year, I sent photos to grandma. She told me of how her and grandpa danced to the live music of Lawrence Welk on the Santa Monica Pier. To be standing in the very place they danced 70+ years prior brought me so much joy. I hadn't ever heard that story before that day. I'm grateful God brought me to that place in the moment and inspired grandma to share the story.

One of grandpa's hobbies was woodworking. He made all sorts of things for us. He would also do art with it. He'd burn outlines of images on the wood and then paint them. I don't have all of those things any longer. But I do have a few that I cherish. When I was young, I didn't have the same appreciation I have now. But I'm glad I didn't loose everything from my youth and can still hold on to memories today; whether only memories or some physical items too.

Grandpa also loved fishing. He and grandma lived on a lake for a while. I remember several times going fishing with grandpa. Sometimes we didn't catch anything. But just being with him was what mattered. And the stories he would tell would keep my interest even when the fish found not interest in our bait...LOL

The lake's name was Heritage. It was a fitting name for what memories I have with my grandpa there. He passed on a lasting heritage of God's Love. There's a community near where I live today that is also called Heritage Lake. I smile every single time I drive by; which is weekly. It's between my home and my grocery...hehehe

Grandpa bought one of those huge VHS camcorders that you had to lug on your shoulder while you recorded. We'd see him capture all of the *best* family moments. All of our holiday gathers were at their house. So, most of the footage was captured there. And most of those years were while they lived at Heritage Lake. Of my fondest, and most traumatizing, memories was when I was *attacked* by a huge white goose...LOL I was wearing a bright red jacket and that goose tore it clean off my body. We still have proof of that somewhere because grandpa recorded the whole thing...LOL Instead of *saving* me from the goose, he must have thought it was something everyone should always remember in full color...HAHAHA

Obviously in the moment, I wasn't all that happy that no one came to my rescue. But looking back, I fondly remember how funny the ordeal actually was. I wasn't harmed in any way. The goose was clearly after my jacket and not me personally. Sure, child Greg was *traumatized*...hehehe But I'm so grateful for memories like that. I love how grandpa loved his family so much that he wanted to re-watch our gatherings over and over again. I do the same thing with my iPhone today. I record little clips and take photos all of the time. And yes, I do go back and watch the videos and look at the photos often. Somewhere, there is a DVD with most of those old home movies, as they used to be called. My cousin had the VHS transferred to DVD before grandpa passed. We all got together and watched them a year or two before he he left this age.





Grandpa always drank that cheap Foldgers instant coffee. I don't care much for it, myself. I still endure it when I visit with grandma since she still drinks it...LOL I imagine they drank it because of the low cost. They lived through some tough times. And even when times weren't tough, they liked what they liked...hehehe I'm more of high quality coffee person. I drink Joffrey's. But the connection to grandpa isn't in the brand or quality. It's in the warmth I feel as I sip that bitter black nectar. I mourn grandpa. I miss grandpa. I love grandpa. And joy comes in the mourning coffee.
