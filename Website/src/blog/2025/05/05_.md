# TBD

## 07:25am

I've been working through this new sleep schedule. I'm learning its value. Especially today. I woke around 6am and was up and about by 6:30am. I've already read through this week's Bible study lesson. And I'm about to make my coffee and toast. I love starting my morning off this way. This is basically what it is like for me on the weekends, since I don't work those days. But being able to have this on a week day, before work, is a welcome change back to the way things were before I shifted my schedule last June.

I enjoyed that schedule for what it was to me. It began as a means to prepare for my first trip to California. I then embraced my natural night owl rhythm. But at the beginning of this year, I began to sense that it might be time to change back to a more normal schedule. That made me sad for a time. But mornings like this encourage me. This isn't the first morning like this for me, actually. I had a few of these last week as well. It was a bit rough when I first started to change to this schedule. But it is balancing out well now.
