# Joy Comes in the Mourning

*Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the [mourning]. You turned my mourning into [coffee];* ~ Psalm 30:5b,11a (paraphrased by *meeeeeee*)

Today is my annual celebration of life for my late paternal grandfather. He left this age and entered into the next on this day in 2019. As I've mentioned before, I wasn't able to mourn his death from 2019 through 2021 on this day. But since 2022, I've been able to mourn in the ways that work best for me for my relationship with him.

I'm grateful for the life that was grandpa. He is an amazing man. I find joy in how I've mourned him these last few years. And God has turned my mourning into coffee...LOL After all, remembering grandpa was why I started drinking coffee in the first place...LOL Today's dose is just extra special...hehehe
