I went to bed last night around midnight. But I didn't get up until around 7:45am...hmmm I'm listening to my body on this one. But it seems as thought that was a long time in bed for me...LOL It has been a while since I averaged such a long slumber. I've been enjoying the 6 to 6 and half hours of sleep I was averaging last year because I could get so much more done in a day. Even as this calendar year began, I was averaging about that. But lately, it seems as though I've needed more sleep. I'm feeling really good. So perhaps my body just needs the rest for now...hehehe
