# Hello 47

Well, I'm a few days into my new year...hehehe And so far, I'm very happy <3

I've been keeping up with reading my journal entries from a year ago. I've failed to keep track of what I'd like to publish in a book, though...LOL I'll have to comb through it all again for that purpose. For now, I'm enjoying reading the thoughts from a year ago...hehehe I had some interesting thoughts. Some I still agree with. Some have changed as my heart has been transforming and have new thoughts.

I'm on track to be all caught up with my Bible in a Year plan this weekend. For the last 5 days, I've tripled up on my reading. It worked out really well. I'd do a reading session on my lunch hour per usual. Then I'd do a second while having my dinner. The third session was while having my evening coffee and snack. It has been working out really well. Tomorrow, I'll do the triple sessions again. And on Sunday, it will just be a double to be all caught up.

I got an email from *The Office of the CEO* yesterday wishing me a happy birthday...hehehe I never expect things like that to actually come from the person. I imagine it was automated. I decided to reply anyway and thank him for the birthday wishes. Shortly after, I got a reply back from the actual CEO...hehehe He had replied from his mobile phone or iPad...because it had that little tag line about *Outlook for iOS* at the end of the message. I was grateful that he actually replied to my gratitude email with further well wishes <3

For the day, I dressed in '50s retro...hehehe Even though I work from home, I wanted to dress up for my happy day. It made me feel good. So, I'm glad I did it. I also went to the movies last night. When I did that, I added a nice hat and my white shoes. I felt so good and it added to my theater experience. It was like stepping back in time to simpler days...hehehe

The movie I saw was Disney's 2025 version of *Snow White*. Snow White is my favorite Disney princess. I was excited to find out that it was opening on my birthday. It felt special. I had some expectations for the film going into it. But those melted away. It was far better than I feared. It isn't a masterpiece like the original animated film. But it was well done in my opinion and I'm glad I saw it in the theater on my birthday.

Last year, I did all of the free things at restaurants who sent me emails about their birthday specials...hehehe I haven't done any of them this year. I've thought about doing a few this weekend. But I'm not sure. I've been enjoying cooking at home again. So, going out to eat isn't all that appealing at the moment. I did a lot of eating out the 2 weeks I was on vacation.

For my birthday dinner, I did the Chilean Sea Bass I mentioned a few days ago. It turned out fantastic. I did a homemade hot honey glaze for the fish and the sugar snap peas. I toss in the remaining hot honey in the fried rice I also made just to use up the sauce. But it didn't add that much flavor difference to the rice...hehehe The fish, though, was amazing with the glaze <3

That's the other thing about eating out. When what I make at home makes me happy, I don't feel like going out as much. I used to go out all the time. But since November, I've had a lot less motivation to eat out...LOL I've really stepped up my game at home these last nearly 5 months. This has made a huge difference in my health and bank account...hehehe
