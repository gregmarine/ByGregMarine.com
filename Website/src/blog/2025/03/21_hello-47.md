# Hello 47

Well, I'm a few days into my new year...hehehe And so far, I'm very happy <3

I've been keeping up with reading my journal entries from a year ago. I've failed to keep track of what I'd like to publish in a book, though...LOL I'll have to comb through it all again for that purpose. For now, I'm enjoying reading the thoughts from a year ago...hehehe I had some interesting thoughts. Some I still agree with. Some have changed as my heart has been transforming and have new thoughts.

I'm on track to be all caught up with my Bible in a Year plan this weekend. For the last 5 days, I've tripled up on my reading. It worked out really well. I'd do a reading session on my lunch hour per usual. Then I'd do a second while having my dinner. The third session was while having my evening coffee and snack. It has been working out really well. Tomorrow, I'll do the triple sessions again. And on Sunday, it will just be a double to be all caught up.
