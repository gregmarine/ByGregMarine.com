# TBD

Transitioning back into my routines is going well. Far better than I expected after being away for 2 weeks. I've slowly gotten back into things. That's what I do...hehehe But it hasn't been the struggle I imagined it would be. In fact, I didn't even struggle for the 2 weeks I wasn't doing my routine. I missed a lot of things. But I was also enjoying being with family. It was a good balance.

One thing from my routine I wasn't all that happy about getting away from was my daily *Bible in a Year* readings. Starting yesterday, I'm tripling up on those to catch up. I have a goal of being back on track by next week. There isn't anything wrong with being behind. I just don't like that I am. If I don't catch up this week, I'm okay with it, though. I made family time a priority over that. I still remained in the word and in prayer the whole time. I just didn't do any of the extra things I love to do...like the BiaY readings...hehehe

But I did learn, in retrospect, that I can still find time for things like that when I'm doing things like vacation or visiting Indiana. I gave it a break so that I could figure that out. My concern was focus. When it comes to prayer and Bible study, I find that I need to focus. Taking the break and observing how things were in those moments for 2 weeks, allowed me to pay attention to how I was feeling and how to recognize opportunities to focus on such things.
