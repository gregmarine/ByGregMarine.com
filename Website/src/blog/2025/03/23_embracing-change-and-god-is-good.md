# Embracing Change and God is Good

I went to bed last night around midnight. But I didn't get up until around 7:45am...hmmm I'm listening to my body on this one. But it seems as thought that was a long time in bed for me...LOL It has been a while since I averaged such a long slumber. I've been enjoying the 6 to 6 and half hours of sleep I was averaging last year because I could get so much more done in a day. Even as this calendar year began, I was averaging about that. But lately, it seems as though I've needed more sleep. I'm feeling really good. So perhaps my body just needs the rest for now...hehehe

An important part of my routine that has been disrupted this month has been my walking. The exception was Disney...hehehe I did a lot of walking there. But the week in Indiana, and this past week, I've done very little walking. I was able to get a good amount of walking in today, though. I did at least 3 miles today. I've walked a little here and there this past week. But not my usual.

In reading my journal entries from a year ago, I was reminded I used to go out most mornings to observe the sunrise. I haven't done that in quite sometime now. I really miss that. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get that back into my routine anytime soon. But it has been on my mind.

Things in life ebbs and flows. I'm doing so much better with that lately...LOL I've been able to embrace these changes and accept them. I do get sad about it sometimes. It can also be frustrating at times. I'm just not letting it distract me from being able to enjoy each day for what it is. I'm also where I'm supposed to be, doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

Of course, I mean that at a high level. I still make my mistakes...LOL Each day isn't perfect. And neither am I...HAHAHA I'm more speaking about how I'm not really in control. All I have control of is how I respond and react to the circumstances I face...LOL

A year ago, I was facing the fact that I was not chosen to go to the new company that I'm at now. At the time, I was facing uncertainty and had to beginning looking into other options for employment. It was a test of my faith and trust in God. I wrote about it in my journal a year ago. I'm glad I did. It was a good reminder of how God got me through that. A few months later, things changed and I ended up at the new company after all. Other opportunities came up. But as I prayed, I saw that those doors weren't the ones God wanted me to open. Looking back, I'm so glad I trusted Him. I feel at peace with where I am now.

In general, I'm glad I'm journaling. There are parts of the Bible that were written as reminders to Israel of who God is and how He saved them. My journal has been sort of like that for me. I sprinkle in things about what God is doing. When I look back at it, I get these amazing reminders. As I face new circumstances, I have something to remind me of who God is and how He has saved me.

My life is full of such stories, actually. I bring them to mind from time to time. I really should write down as much as I can while I can do that. The reminders will be nice for me. But they may also help someone else in the future. We don't also know the impact we make on others. So, it's important to tell the story of how God is working in our lives.

Cherie and I didn't get to do our Bible study fellowship last weekend. So today, we did 2 weeks worth of the Bible study. Most of our call was us doing those study lessons this time...hehehe We did have a little time for some friendship time too. But it was abbreviated a little compared to most weeks due to the extra lesson in our Bible study...LOL

It was so good to see her today. As of last weekend, we have been doing the fellowship through devotionals and Bible studies for a year now. We've been doing the calls for about a month longer than that. It has been a Blessing to do the fellowship and grow the friendship. I'm grateful we are able to do both. God is so good to us.

Today was a full day. I love days like this. It was paced well and was mostly time spent with God.
