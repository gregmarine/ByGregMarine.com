It's officially opening day for 2025 Major League Baseball!!! Yay!!! I'll not get to see all of the games this year. In fact, I was only able to see the highlights of the Tokyo Series. But I've been able to watch tonight's opener at Dodgers Stadium. Woohoo!!!

I missed the ceremonies at the beginning. They raised the flag and revealed the 2024 baseball. They also had the trophy delivered by Ice Cube...hehehe I was working on my Bible study while all of that was going on. I didn't even know it was going to happen, actually...LOL So, I didn't even know I was missing it while I was missing it...LOL
