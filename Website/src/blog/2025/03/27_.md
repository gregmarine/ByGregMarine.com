# TBD

It's officially opening day for 2025 Major League Baseball!!! Yay!!! I'll not get to see all of the games this year. In fact, I was only able to see the highlights of the Tokyo Series. But I've been able to watch tonight's opener at Dodgers Stadium. Woohoo!!!

I missed the ceremonies at the beginning. They raised the flag and revealed the 2024 baseball. They also had the trophy delivered by Ice Cube...hehehe I was working on my Bible study while all of that was going on. I didn't even know it was going to happen, actually...LOL So, I didn't even know I was missing it while I was missing it...LOL

When I posted my birthday coffee mug last week, a great conversation ensued on Twitter. For one of my online friends, I was able to hunt down a way for them to get themselves the same mug. I found mine at EPCOT. They live on the West Coast now and won't likely be at EPCOT anytime soon. I found the same mug on the Disney Store website. Well, today, she posted that she had received hers...hehehe It made my heart so happy that she was able to get one too. I had been missing interactions like this on my socials. I'm so grateful that this happened. Genuine connection is amazing <3

I enjoyed my theater experience so much last week that I think I may go to a movie this weekend. I may make this a regular thing. Probably not weekly. But monthly, perhaps? I used to go to the movies often. I mostly went by myself. I'd say most of the movies I've seen in the theater were by myself, actually...hehehe But I also love going with others. Due to the pandemic, I got out of the vibe. The prices seem to have soared compared to what I recall. I'm not sure, though...LOL Maybe it has always been expensive. Since I've canceled most of my streaming services, and I eat out a lot less, I have room for the theater experience...hehehe But if there is a month without any movies I'm interested in, I probably won't go.

The creative side of my brain has been resting for a bit. I may have to do something soon to wake that back up. I keep starting to do something. And then it falls back to sleep...LOL But I'm not forcing it. I just keep poking at it to see if I'm ready. I look forward to being inspired again.
