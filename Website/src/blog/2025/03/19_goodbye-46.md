# Goodbye 46

I've reflected on this past year a lot this month. Especially this week now that I'm back home again. I had a full year. And today I say goodbye to being 46. Tomorrow, I increment that number to 47...hehehe

I had a good year. It makes me feel very Blessed. Noticed the capital *B* there? I acknowledge God as the author of my journey. I'm very grateful for all that He has provided. I had to weather several storms this past year. But He didn't allow me to sink...hehehe

A year ago, I was getting ready for the Dodgers to open their season on my birthday. And I had planned to visit some botanical gardens that day. I watched most of that game, and I visited several gardens...hehehe It was a beautiful day and a great way to start off my personal New Year.

Back then, I didn't look at my birthday as a personal New Year. I was inspired to start looking at it this way when Cherie started talking about it for her birthday last year. So, this year is the first time I'm celebrating it as a New Year.

As an added bonus, my birthday is also the first day of Spring. At least this year, it is. It isn't every year. But it is most. And I personally feel that the year should begin in Spring. This is the season when things begin to wake up from their Winter slumber...hehehe

Spring is my favorite time of year. Although, I don't really dislike any season anymore. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Spring. I suppose that could be because of my birthday. But deep down, I just love to see things wake up...hehehe

But I also love that time when we fall asleep. So, the Fall can also be a lovely time for me. Summer and Winter are a mixed bag...LOL I still love those seasons, though.

I'm planning to have Chilean Sea Bass for dinner tomorrow. When I bought it, the package had 2 portions. With how expensive it is, I decided to make it on special occasions. The first one I made for Valentine's Day. It was fantastic. I saved this second portion for my birthday...hehehe

I'm considering going to see Snow White. It opens tomorrow. Well, the official opening is Friday. But for some reason, theaters start to show it the day before the opening date. Which just so happens to be my birthday this time...LOL Snow White is my personal favorite Disney princess. I love how the opening falls on my birthday...hehehe

I have mixed feelings about this film. It's a live action remake. Per the teasers, it appears they messed with the plot. I'm not thrilled about live action remakes of classic Disney animated films. Especially since this one is my favorite and the first ever feature length animated film. Not just Disney's...the first of any studio...hehehe

But I'm keeping an open mind. And I'll try to see it as independently as I can from the original...hehehe I've done that with the other live action remakes. The exception would be *The Lion King*. It was a true replica of the animated film. I liked that...hehehe

Other than those 2 things, my day will be as normal as most days. I will be working and going through most of my routine as usual. I decided I didn't really want to go out of my way to make the day any more special than I already feel it is for me this year. I have a sober soul about this particular birthday.

What will this new year be like for me? I'm looking forward to experiencing it. This last one was amazing <3
