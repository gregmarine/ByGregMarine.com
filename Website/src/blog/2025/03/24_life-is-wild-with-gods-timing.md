# Life is Wild with God's Timing

Weird sleep continued last night...LOL I went to bed at midnight. My white noise app turned off at 6:30am. I woke up around 7:15am...hehehe I'm glad my body and mind are getting sleep. It just seems like more than I need. But I've also been experiencing some strange dreams.

Work is speeding up again. We are getting into production testing season. The *Big Bang* weekend is in mid-May. So, I'm glad we are finally getting into the production testing. I had been getting my systems all setup. And then I had to wait for some stuff. That is all finally happening. We have a kickoff meeting with the business users on Thursday. Hopefully they'll be able to start testing by the end of the week or start of next week.

Other than that, most of my work right now is busy work. I have some documentation that I'm working on that needs finished. And I'm setting up some things that nobody has ever gotten around to doing. We are using this spare time to take care of all these other little things.

I learned a lesson making dinner tonight ü§≠ I made a mistake and had to start over...but I don‚Äôt see it as a failure so much as I see it as an opportunity to learn ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è I made chowmein and stumbled a bit while draining the water from cooking the noodles. The noodles ended up in the sink...LOL I've actually done that before. But it was a long time ago when I was having trouble with my tremor. Tonight, I was just being silly...LOL I was doing something *fancy* and oops! I shrugged and decided I learned something...LOL

I thanked God for how I handled this mishap. I remember how I used to feel when I would make a mistake like this. I would feel disappointed in myself. Especially when I'm so hungry and knew that it would take longer to get to the satisfaction of eating...LOL There were times when I would just give up and go out to eat. Or I would just eat snack foods so I wouldn't have to start over. But this time, I wasn't even sad about it. I was very hungry and didn't like that I had set myself back another 20 mins or so. But I was okay with it. And dinner worked out the second time <3

I was able to get in 3 miles of walking again today. Today felt like I was back to my favorite routine...hehehe The *life* around the pond today was *wild*...LOL There was so much wildlife today <3 I even saw my first racer snake! I've heard we have those here. But I still hadn't seen one...LOL So, it became today's featured photo...hehehe I saw a new lizard. And I counted at least 15 species of birds! I think there might have been more because I stopped counting...LOL My walks today made me so happy <3

I'm watching the Dodgers play against the Angels. This is one of the games I almost went to. Tonight's and tomorrow's are two games I was looking at going to. Those plans didn't work out. I was sad about that. But I'm glad I am still able to watch them. 

The timing for the games would have allowed me to still work today and tomorrow. And then be able to go see the games. I probably wouldn't have gotten much sleep...LOL But I think I could have made that work...hehehe That's one of the nice things about my visits to California. On days like this for these sort of events, I could probably work and then still go to the events. That's because my work schedule is on the eastern time zone. And things like these games are on pacific. Not everything would have that kind of timing; because some things would be earlier in the day in California. But these games would have worked out, I think.

Anyway, I think things worked out for the best anyway. I'm learning to trust God's timing for things. It's hard. But when I do trust Him, I see that things are better. I wouldn't have experienced all of today's wildlife if I were in California today...LOL j/k

I would have gone to one of the games with Cherie. I know we will eventually get to do it. That's one of things that made me sad about us not getting to go. I didn't get to see my deer friend üò≠ I'm glad we are able to still watch them *together* from our separate homes on TV...hehehe We are wearing the same shirt tonight <3

I've seen the stadium in person. The night we last said goodbye to each other in person, we were at the ARTIC train station; which is across the street from Angels Stadium. It looked amazing ü§© The hotel I'd be staying in is also near the train station and stadium. That whole area looks lovely and I look forward to having an adventure there someday <3

I had another great day. And I love that it is ending with Dodgers baseball! I had forgotten how much fun this game is. I stopped following in the late 90's I think. I didn't start following again until last year. I'm so glad I picked it back up. It is one of the few sports I played as a kid and I used to follow it through the 80's and most of the 90's. I collected the cards and got into the games each season. My team back then was the Cubs. But I was a fan of the sport and cheered on many teams. I'm a fan of the Dodgers now. But it's fun to see other teams too. There really isn't any other sport quite like it. At least in the United States of America.
