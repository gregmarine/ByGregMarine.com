# TBD

I've been away from writing for quite a while! My last post was over 3 weeks ago!!! Which seems crazy considering how often I wrote before this 3 week hiatus...LOL A lot has happened in these 3 weeks. And I'm unlikely to write about it all today...LOL I do better about writing things as they are happening. I am not good at recapping things after all this time. But I'll do my best to write about some of it today...hehehe I've missed this!

That first week was mostly a break from writing, actually. I had written so often, my mind was a little empty for a bit...LOL I just didn't have a lot to say. That doesn't mean I stopped thinking...hehehe I just didn't feel like writing. I wasn't burned out or anything.

The second week was a Disney vacation with my nephews. I thought I would break away and so some writing in the evenings. Nope! I never really broke away. The few times I didn't join them with something, I was busy doing something else...hehehe I'm so glad they invited me to join them on their vacation. It was my younger nephew's Spring Break. The older one was just taking vacation from work. They were both also celebrating their birthdays. Since mine is this month, we celebrate mine too. Plus, my grandmother's birthday is this month. So, we actually celebrated 4 birthdays that week...LOL We got some Disney birthday buttons to wear each day.
