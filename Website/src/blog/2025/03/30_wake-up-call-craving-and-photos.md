# Wake-Up Call, Craving, and Photos?

Overall, today was a great day. There were a few things that happened that weren't so great. But I'm really happy with today...hehehe

I was woken up by an emergency phone call from my son. He's fine now, though. Although the circumstances weren't ideal, I was so happy to have spent the first hour and 17 minutes of my day *with* him <3

I enjoyed today's Bible in a Year reading. I began Judges today. Since it's a *new* book for the year, today's session includes the BibleProject overview of Judges. I enjoy those...hehehe And I'm still enjoying the daily Bible recap podcast I've been doing each time. I did today's reading while having my breakfast toast and coffee. I like weekends for that. During the week, I typically do the session while having my lunch. But I prefer the breakfast time for this. I've tried to wake up earlier to allow myself to do this during the week. So far, that isn't working out well...LOL So, for now, I can only do this on the weekends when I don't have a start time for work...hehehe

Today's church service was a combined hybrid of the traditional and contemporary. I've been preferring the traditional lately. But I typically watch both. Having a single combined is a little weird for me...hehehe But that's definitely okay with me from time to time. The thing I don't like the most is that I don't get to hear the sermon twice on these Sundays. I've been enjoying the double messages by tuning into both services each week...hehehe But today's didn't need a double listen. I connected with it well enough the one time.

Because of my excursion with my sister yesterday, I didn't make it to the grocery yesterday. I was out of meals. So, I didn't have anything to prepare for lunch today. I decided I was feed a craving I've been having. I wanted to get a hamburger at Culver's...LOL I don't really know why I've been craving them. It might be from the commercials I've been seeing...LOL I went there for lunch today and had a sourdough melt with a single beef patty, caramelized onions, and swiss cheese. And I had their fries as a side. After that, I decided I wanted a couple of scoops of their frozen custard too...hehehe I enjoyed this cheat treat! I then went to the grocery to stock up for the week.

By the time I got home and unloaded the groceries, I decided I needed a nap before my weekly call with Cherie. I'm glad I did. Although I had about 6 and half hours of sleep last night, the sudden wake up call left me feeling drowsy. My nap was about an hour. It was exactly what I needed in the moment.

I took a lot of photos today. I had wondered this morning if I would feel motivated to continue doing this all year. Today's is the 89th featured photo for the year. That doesn't include the hundreds I've taken...that's just the ones I've posted with dates...hehehe This morning, I was tempted to stop doing it. The goal was to feature one every day. It wasn't a resolution for the year or anything like that. Just an idea. But I ended up taking almost as many today as I did yesterday...LOL I think the reason I'm thinking about ending the daily photo is because most of them come from around the pond I walk around. But I think that's okay. It's a huge part of most of my days. There isn't anything wrong with that. If anything, it keeps me looking for new things in the same spots. I see that as a good thing.

I got a lot of sun yesterday. I don't use any sort of sunblock anymore. I would if I were to go to the beach. But on a casual day like yesterday, I didn't feel I needed it. I probably did after all...LOL That said, I didn't actually burn. I already had a base tan. I keep that year round now that I live in Florida. Today, I've been moisturizing my arms, neck, and face to keep the skin from peeling. I didn't burn. But the tan is much deeper now...hehehe If I allow the skin to dry too much, it will peel. And sometimes, the tan and burning process can continue long after the sun exposure if it really is too much. So the lotion I use helps with that too.
