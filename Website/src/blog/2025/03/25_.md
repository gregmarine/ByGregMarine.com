## 07:45am

Good morning! My sleep hit the mark a little better this time...hehehe I didn't go to bed until around 12:30am this time, though. I watched the Dodgers game last night. They lost in the bottom of the 9th to the Angels. Fortunately, this game didn't count...LOL But I hope they win tonight! Anyway, I got up around 7:15am. So, just about 6 and half hours of sleep. And I feel fantastic!

I'm so glad to be back to journaling. I really missed it for the 3 weeks I didn't journal. It felt so weird not to be writing...anything! Now, I'm back on a nearly daily pace again.

Normally, I've done these timestamp entries to help me get back into the swing of things. When I went back to writing last week, I didn't do one, though. Today, I was inspired by Cherie to do one...hahaha Something I really love about these is that it feels like going on a journey throughout the day when we go back and read them again. A year from now, I'll likely read this and enjoy the day all over again. At least, I hope I can enjoy it this first time around...LOL So, here we goooooo! (In classic Disney Peter Pan's voice, of course)
