MASSIVE DEADLY FIRE AT EPCOT...not! There was a fire at EPCOT today. But a few of the headlines for the breaking news on those silly Disney "news" sites used phrases like *massive* and *deadly*. That's why I don't follow those sources. They sensationalize things to the extreme as click bait. The fire was behind the bakery in the France pavilion and appears to have just been a small  building that caught fire. No injuries were reported and the fire was quickly extinguished. *Thanks to the convenience of mobile phone cameras*, there were a few videos posted quickly on social media about it. The plume of smoke was pretty big and was black. So it looked far worse than it actually was. I'm glad no one was hurt and they were able to contain it quickly. They only had to close off and evacuate the France pavilion. I applaud the first responders and Cast for keeping everyone safe and taking care of it so quickly.
