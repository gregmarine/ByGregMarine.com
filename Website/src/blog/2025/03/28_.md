# TBD

Well, going to the movies this weekend is a no-go...LOL My sister reached out to me to see if I wanted to hang out with her tomorrow...hehehe It made my heart happy to find out she had the day off and wanted to spend it with me. I don't yet know what we'll be doing. But I have some ideas to pitch. Going to the Disney parks is not on that list...LOL But doing some resort hopping and maybe Disney Springs is on the very bottom of the list...hehehe The rest of my ideas are down south of where we live. She already lives south of me. But there are some places I've been wanting to check out that are further south. It should be a fun day regardless of what we end up doing.
