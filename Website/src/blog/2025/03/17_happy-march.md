# Happy March

I've been away from writing for quite a while! My last post was over 3 weeks ago!!! Which seems crazy considering how often I wrote before this 3 week hiatus...LOL A lot has happened in these 3 weeks. And I'm unlikely to write about it all today...LOL I do better about writing things as they are happening. I am not good at recapping things after all this time.

I've missed this!

That first week was mostly a break from writing, actually. I had written so often, my mind was a little empty for a bit...LOL I just didn't have a lot to say. That doesn't mean I stopped thinking...hehehe I just didn't feel like writing. I wasn't burned out or anything.

The second week was a Disney vacation with my nephews. I thought I would break away and do some writing in the evenings. Nope! I never really broke away. The few times I didn't join them with something, I was busy doing something else...hehehe I'm so glad they invited me to join them on their vacation. It was my younger nephew's Spring Break. The older one was just taking vacation from work. They were both also celebrating their birthdays. Since mine is this month, we celebrate mine too. Plus, my grandmother's birthday is this month. So, we actually celebrated 4 birthdays that week...LOL We got some Disney birthday buttons to wear each day.

Last week, I was in Indiana visiting family. I especially spent time with my son. I also worked. So, after work, I would spend time with my son. I really enjoyed the time spent with family. I had been missing that. Last week, combined with the week before being with my nephews, I spent a lot of time with family this month...hehehe

You could say that I spent the last part of my personal year with family. I feel it was a great way to send off the year and start my personal New Year this week. With my birthday being just a few days away, I feel glad that I ended this past year the way I did.

This was my favorite year. I can sum it up as a year of personal growth. My heart went through a transformation. It began a year ago today with the first devotional I did in fellowship with my deer friend, Cherie. We've been on an amazing journey with God ever since. Through the devotionals and Bible studies we've done, I've connected with God in new and amazing ways. Growing closer to God has helped heal me spiritually and given me new ways to see things. God has opened my eyes and ears. It was like I was blind and deaf. But now I can see and hear...hehehe

I have a new hope that I didn't have a year ago. I hadn't yet achieved a good self-awareness yet. But this past year, I finally have some clarity in my mind about how I view my own character. I have a much better understanding about my feelings. My desires and motives aren't so abstract in my mind anymore. I never have any sort of hidden agenda or anything like that. I just wasn't so aware of things about myself because I would spend a lot of energy giving others what they needed or wanted from me.

I hope to get back into a routine with this website here in the second half of the month. Being away from home for 2 weeks really did a number on my routine...LOL I've been home for a few days now. I've started getting back into some of the things I love to do. So, I should be back to my *normal* soon.

I made chowmein for dinner tonight...hehehe I missed that so much. I missed cooking in general...LOL After I got my car when I arrived Saturday, I went straight to the grocery on my way home...hehehe I thought about eating out and resting. Then going to the grocery the next day. Nope! I thought it best to get my groceries immediately and get back to cooking at home.

It's official! I'm staying in my current home another year. I signed the lease yesterday and the property manager signed today. Last year, I struggled with where I would live. I didn't want to be here for sure. That all changed at the end of the last calendar year. And over the last few months, I prayed about it and discerned that remaining here another year was best. So, I have another year to discover where I am to live. Even with feeling good about staying here now, I don't see myself staying after this next year. But it isn't because I'm not happy being here. I just get a sense that it is my last year. We shall see!

I'm glad to be back to writing here in this journal. I didn't write much today...LOL But at least I wrote something...LOL
