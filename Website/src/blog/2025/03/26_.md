# TBD

As of the beginning of the month, I'm back to sleeping on the floor. Just before my vacation, I finally settle in on a new floor mattress. I had been thinking about it for a while and was *window* shopping at Amazon. When my nephews invited me to be a part of their Disney vacation, I seized the opportunity to make a final decision. I chose one that I could use in the hotel room at Disney. I didn't want to share a bed with one of them. Not because I have an issue with them...hehehe It's just that I don't really like sharing a bed...LOL That goes all the way back to childhood. I only share a bed with my spouse or my son. Since I'm not married, and Malachi wasn't on this trip, that meant I would rather sleep on the floor...LOL I like it. It folds up nicely and has a carry case for travel. I could technically check it into the airlines as checked baggage if I wanted. I'm not likely going to do that. But it is perfect for my use at home and if I need a bed when I visit places I can drive to.
