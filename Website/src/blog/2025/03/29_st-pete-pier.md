# St. Pete Pier

Today was such a lovely day. As I mentioned yesterday, I was to spend the day with my sister. I had a full list of ideas for us to do. It all came down to going to Gizella Kopsick Arboretum in St Petersburg. This is the same palm tree arboretum I started my 2024 birthday with...hehehe I was wanting to get back to it someday. Today turned out to be that day.

It looked like the property had taken on some damage from all the hurricanes we experienced last season. I imagine the big one that destroyed the Tampa Bay Rays stadium did the most damage. But I was glad to see that most of it was still in good shape.

While we were there, it looks like a wedding was getting setup. The wedding party had arrived and the ceremony equipment was being set. Before we left, we even saw them taking some photos...hehehe It looked like they were all there via a really fancy 1920's speakeasy themed bus. I wish I had taken a photo of the bus. It was amazing! Later in the day, we saw the bus again. I imagine they were on their way to the reception...hehehe Congrats to the happy couple!
