# TBD

I had another nightmare last night. This one was more about how *I'm not good enough*. Of course, that isn't true. But I've been in situations where I was made to feel that way. I'm not really sure where these nightmares are coming from all of a sudden. But I otherwise feel rested. I didn't wake with anxiety this time. I had more of a sense of *overcoming* those past feelings. I know my *worth* now.

Today's entry wasn't drafted by hand first. I decided to type it out from the get-go so I could focus more on its purpose. A week ago, I had a travel day to California for what became my favorite vacation. I handwrote notes throughout the trip in hopes that I would journal about it all when I got home. So, I'll be starting that process today by talking about that first day.
