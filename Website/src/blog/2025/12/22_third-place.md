# Third Place

### 2025/12/22

I had to use white noise again last night and started out with it before I even went to sleep. My neighbor was already making noises that kept me from shutting down my brain. He wasn't being obnoxious or anything out of hand. It's just the nature of my building. It must be made of paper... LOL

I had several vivid dreams last night and one was a night terror. Did yesterday's sermon influence my *sweet dreams*?! LOL j/k With the terror, I woke myself up screaming. I wonder if my neighbors heard that... LOL I sure hope not... hehehe Perhaps being back on the white noise is impacting my sleep?

Although I woke with a little anxiety from the dreams, my heart was otherwise filled with joy today. I put a photo of my cross on the necklace to carry around today. Cherie inspired that from when she mentioned cross necklaces she was looking for us to have.

Along with everything else I'm thinking about for 2026, I have 21 days of prayer and fasting on my mind. I think I'd like to start off the new year with a season of prayer and fasting again. I just need to decide how I want to go about it this time.

I went to the post office today to send off Christmas presents. While there, I decided to pick up a Google Play Store gift card for Malachi. I'd normally do that electronically. But I thought a physical card would be nice this time. I used my debit card for that, but there was an issue activating the gift card after the transaction. They couldn't refund to my card, so they gave me part in cash and part as a money order. Their till didn't have enough to cover the whole refund... LOL I'll have to get the gift card electronically now and do something with that money order.

"Christmas on the Beach" won third place in the Christmas art contest at work! I'm overjoyed that it won a prize and my heart is so happy <3 I don't think I've ever won anything like this before. I'm so glad it was with this piece. That isn't why I made it. But this award adds to just how special this is, as it means so much to me. Joann and Cherie both now own an award winning original by Greg Marine, and my first award winner... hehehe

The last few days I've been writing a time stamp entry and then building the blog post from that. I'm thinking about taking this approach in the new year if I commit to journaling daily. I'm also looking into various styles of journaling to see what other ways I might write to keep things fresh. I don't want to give myself a chore to do. I simply want to document my journey as I go along. I want to add to the journey and not take anything away. So we'll see what comes of all this. I've enjoyed it this month. The daily journaling, that is. Overall, I've very much enjoyed journaling often these past two years <3
