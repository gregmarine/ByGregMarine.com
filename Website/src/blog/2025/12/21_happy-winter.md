# Happy Winter

### 2025/12/21

Winter is here! I haven't always enjoyed the change of season. But my growth these past few years has helped me appreciate the seasons. And that has further helped me appreciate the grander seasons of life. Embracing seasons, or chapters as I sometimes think of them, has been life changing <3

I woke at 1 am to my neighbor again and needed to employ the white noise for the third night in a row. I think he has his mother's dog with him. That's probably where the extra late night activity is coming from. He's otherwise quite the considerate upstairs neighbor.

I'm really excited about the Bible study Cherie is sending me. We'll begin the study in the new year. I know nothing about it yet... LOL I'm excited to find out what it is. And she is excited for me to find out. The anticipation is exciting <3 I enjoy the tease of knowing that it's coming without knowing what to expect. Her excitement and tease adds to this experience <3

Church was lovely, as usual. It isn't always. It just usually is... hehehe From time to time they have technical difficulties that distract. And the occasional "joyful noise" that also distracts. I love the sermons at CUMC. They aren't flashy and aren't always "modern." They are down to earth, understandable, and very relatable. I feel this church is still connected with the deeper meanings of scripture and not surface level. I've been tuning in for just over a year now and I'm so happy that Cherie introduced me to them.

I went out briefly to pick out one last gift this morning. This was officially my last for this year... hehehe Have I mentioned how much I enjoyed Christmas shopping this year? LOL

When I got home, I went on a lovely prayer walk. The weather was so beautiful to enjoy such a walk. So I'm grateful for the opportunity. It had been quite a while since I've taken a walk around the lake.

Both of the "Christmas on the Beach" cards arrived safely in their new homes. I'm so excited about that project. My heart is happy that it went well and brought joy. I should find out tomorrow if it also won the art contest. But that isn't important. That will just be a plus... hehehe

I finished wrapping all of the Christmas gifts that need to be shipped. I'll run to the post office tomorrow to mail them. The rest of the gifts I'll finish and pack for my trip to Indiana. I bought new luggage to help with my travels. The new luggage should be of help with that. And I'll be able to bring home some, or all, of the Christmas gifts I receive.

This is a great end to a great year. And it will be a great start for a great new year. I never actually know how things will go. But I know that I am so blessed <3

Remember this day and what it means to you <3 Happy Winter 2025 <3
