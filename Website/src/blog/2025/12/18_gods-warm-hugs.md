# God's Warm Hugs

### 2025/12/18

Today did not have any weirdness to it. All of my interactions with people felt organic and natural. I haven't a clue what happened yesterday... LOL There were so many weird moments... hehehe But today was normal.

I have a training module that is due on Christmas Eve. It was assigned quite awhile ago. I've been pretty good about knocking those out quickly. But I didn't for this one. I started it today. Yep! *Started* it! LOL Each section has a video to watch. So far, each video has been an hour... ugh. I have 5 more to watch. So I'm glad I started today. I hope to have that complete tomorrow.

I did a little more work on my latest poem tonight. It is going really well. I actually jumped up and down with excitement and joy for what I wrote tonight... LOL I have the first drafts of parts 1 and 2 written now. Each part has 2 stanzas. I may be able to complete the first draft of part 3 this weekend and begin refining the entire poem. It tells a good story in a fun and playful way. Writing things like this is one of the many joys in my life right now. I'm grateful and it makes my heart happy <3

I've been in deep thought today. Some of my replies on social media today have reflected this. And I wrote some notes on some *Vitamin G* I'm working on. I think part of this is due to the season of reflection December is for me. I love it and wouldn't have it any other way. I always hope it's the warm hug someone needs. It's one of the ways I can be God's Love in this world. He always gives the best warm hugs... hehehe

God's Warm Hugs are what I feel this world needs right now. So many bad things are impacting so many people. It's always that way. But somehow it seems to be getting worse. I cannot say it has been easy, but I'm doing better than expected with everything. I'm spending a lot of time in prayer and looking to God's Word for comfort. When I seek Him in the darkness, I find His Light. I somewhat chuckle because I keep wondering how things can get worse... and then it gets worse... hehehe Yet I still have hope for a better future to come. God's Word puts perspective on things and prayer seems to realign my heart. God is so good... even when things in life aren't <3
