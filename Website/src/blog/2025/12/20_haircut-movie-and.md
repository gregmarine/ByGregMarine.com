# Haircut, Movie, and...

### 2025/12/20

Today was a really good day. I slept well. But I hit snooze twice... LOL I rarely do that. Today was a good day to sleep in though. I had to turn on my white noise around 2am. My upstairs neighbor was a bit noisy again.

I had the bagel I got last night for my breakfast today. I had forgotten to have her slice it for me. But that was probably a good idea. I sliced it and it remained soft overnight. I've had their sliced ones next day and they don't toast very well. This one toasted great. I did my usual journal reading while eating and having my coffee.

After breakfast, I got a haircut. My favorite gal wasn't there today. But the gal who did it today did an amazing job. I absolutely love the haircut. There is something so freeing about a haircut. But when it turns out well, it's even better... hehehe I miss doing it myself. But I don't know how I could do it the way I have it done now.

I made a quick trip to the grocery to get food for the few days I'll be home. I went to Publix instead of Sprouts. It's actually been a while since I've been to Sprouts. I miss it... hehehe I'll try to get back there after my Indiana trip. I only needed some bare essentials to tie me over until my trip.

I went to the movies to see "Zootopia 2" after lunch. I absolutely loved it. The story was really good, the voice acting was spot on, and the animation was well done. I liked it slightly better than the first one, and it helped make more sense out of the "Better Zoogether" show at Animal Kingdom... hehehe I saw on Disney+ that there is a Zootopia TV show that I'd like to check out soon.

I wore my new fedora when I went to the movies. I hadn't worn it out yet. Only Trex had ever worn it in one of his videos...LOL I also wore one of my retro shirts. I really loved how I looked today and how I felt. That's a good feeling and I'm so grateful to be finding that vibe right now.

I spent much of the afternoon and evening working on Bingford's presents for Cherie and her mom. That's been a fun project that's actually been ongoing for months. Bingford was such a special gift to me. I imagine Bingford will have other adventures and related projects. But this one is his first... hehehe So I wanted to make this special for her and her mom.

I hope to finish the rest of my presents over the next few days. Some of them need to be mailed. Others will come with me on the plane Wednesday. I really enjoyed Christmas shopping this year. Only two gifts were ordered online. I found everything else in stores while shopping. I've missed doing that. I actually started in August... LOL I finished this past week.

It looks like the Marine Family Christmas went well again this year. I'm grateful Malachi was able to go. My family invites his mother every year and she brings him. I love that and it makes my heart happy. Last year is the only time I've been since I moved down to Florida. So I'm glad his mom takes him. And I'm glad she has a good time.

Beyond the hijinks of Bingford's letters, I didn't get around to my writing projects today. I may make some time for that tomorrow. I've really enjoyed what I'm working on right now. I'm finding so much joy in writing, sketching, and painting lately. All on e-ink, of course... hehehe Except for Bingford's letters, those were written out on real paper... hehehe
