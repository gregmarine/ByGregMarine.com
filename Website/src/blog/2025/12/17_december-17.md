This felt like a weird day. It wasn't a bad day, Just weird. Some of my interactions with people were a little off. Some of my own personal experiences were a little off as well. Just a weird day... hehehe

That said, I had a lovely evening. I had dinner at my sister's house. I shared the highlights and photos of our November vacation with her. We did a Christmas gift exchange. And we watched the Charlie Brown Christmas show. She acknowledged I'm the only *Marine* she gets to see this Christmas. So it was very special for us <3

I enjoyed today's Humpty Dumpty Day Tale that Cherie and I wrote. It was another tale where our egg-cellent hero couldn't catch a break. The poor guy... hehehe These Humpty Dumpty Day Tales have been one of many highlights this year. I'm grateful <3

I've continued handwriting these journal entries. I haven't been posting the original drafts since I started using the Tab X C for publishing. I finally found a way to do the images. The PDFs will return soon. Today I'm writing with one of my "pencils" instead of a "pen." I used this "pencil" to start my latest short story and thought writing this entry with the same stylus would be fun. For the short story, a handwritten letter is a part of the plot. So I connected with the protagonist by writing with the stylus that feels like an actual pencil, as that is what the character would have used to write the letter... hehehe

I found out the art contest at work has closed voting by a specific group within the company. It's like a committee of voters this time. They usually open it up to company wide voting. We find out the winner on Monday. I have no expectations of winning. I hope the group likes it, though. I made it for the Christmas card. So it has served its purpose well. That makes my heart happy <3

I finished the Blended Gospels book from *The Chosen* last night. I may not read it again. I don't like it as much as I thought I would. I know others have written similar versions that I'd love to read. I just didn't like this one the way I expected.

I so rarely talk about things I didn't enjoy. I typically only talk about the things I do enjoy. I see so many talking about what they hate. I would like to hear what they love too, though. So I talk mostly about what I love. But I'm considering talking about things I don't love. Perhaps people might find my opinions useful. Just a thought for now.

I got a new mug from my sister to add to the collection. It's Christmas themed with a vintage Santa all over. The handle is green and the inside is red. I absolutely love this mug. It is so me! She picked it because she knows that I started drinking coffee when Grandpa died. The Santa reminds her of Grandpa's Santa collection. Most of the Santa's were vintage like this mug. So she thought of him and me and the coffee connection with Grandpa. That makes the mug even more meaningful to me <3

I couldn't come up with a clever title...LOL
