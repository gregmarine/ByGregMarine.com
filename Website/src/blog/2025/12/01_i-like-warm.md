# I Like Warm

### 2025/12/01

I decided to abandon my journal entry from my travel Friday... LOL I never got around to writing this weekend, for good reason. I was with family all weekend... hehehe Today I'm back to work and can write on breaks. I tried to do a *morning, afternoon, evening* format today. I also abandoned that... LOL But I'm still writing today.

I'm struggling a little on this visit. I had struggles on my last visit as well. But I'm okay and I appreciate being here this week. My parents are being wonderful and doing everything to make my visit wonderful in their own way. I'm grateful for what they do for me on my visits. I'm making the most of this. I still don't have the words to describe my feelings other than to say I just don't fit. But that's okay.

The heat went out at Mom and Dad's house last night. It got pretty cold because it's below freezing outside. We are in a Winter Advisory. It's like January weather... hehehe They gave me a cute LOL little space heater to use in my room so I could work today. It has this cute fake fireplace thing on it. I turned that on, of course... LOL The HVAC repair person came and they have heat once more... hehehe

I brought my desk light with me. I prefer it to see my work area better. Especially now that e-ink devices are part of my workflow. Well, I forgot the mount to attach it to the desk... LOL So, I ordered a new light to use and just leave here for the visits when I work.

I also finally ordered a HDMI cable to connect the external monitor to my work laptop. I've been bringing one from home. I'm grateful I can do this work setup here now. It used to be so much harder to work here because I didn't have a full office setup. Everything fits in the closet and is out of the way when someone else visits or when I visit without working.

Christmas season officially began for me on Friday. I've been listening to Christmas music since... hehehe Today, Cherie put me onto a playlist that has some songs I've not heard before. And there are versions of classics I've always known that are pretty good. I really enjoy Christmas music. But I'm glad it's seasonal. Listening to seasonal music in the *proper* season brings a balance to it. And it gives me something to look forward to as the seasons change.

I haven't made a post about our Disney trip from a few weeks ago. I still haven't gone through all of the photos and videos. I put a lot of myself into those posts. Those moments are so special to me. The posts are part of the experience. I want to give this post the focus it deserves. But I hope to bring it all together soon.

I had a lovely time with Mom tonight. We stayed in town because of the winter storm that dumped snow on us. We had dinner, went to Walmart, and dropped something off at Grandma's. I love those mother-son date nights we've been doing this year. And now they have more meaning because of the cancer. I'm grateful for Mom. And I feel Blessed that she is doing so well with the treatments. God is good!

When Dad got home, he made us our evening coffee. I think he loves making me coffee. It's one of his ways to say "I love you, Greg" through action. But he also says the words now too. He used to be the type who felt you should know he loved you without the words. But he knows how important those words are to me and says them now.

We finished the evening watching TV. Mom kept dozing off. The chemo has really taken it out of her. She'll get the next treatment this Wednesday. She'll be fine until the weekend because of the steroids they give with the chemo. But she'll *crash* this weekend and sleep a lot. She's got this because He's got her <3

Today was a good day. The good stuff outweighed the struggles. And thankfully the heat is working now. I hope it remains working... LOL I like warm...
