# I'm Old

### 2025/12/06

Despite the title of this entry, I'm not actually old. But there are things that make me feel old. Like when apps change their interface. Or when Apple changes so many things at the OS level... LOL That has been happening a lot lately. Some of the changes kind of make sense. Some leave me screaming "WWWHHHYYY???" HAHAHA j/k But most changes leave me relearning how things work. And that can make me feel old... hehehe

I'm still adjusting settings on my iPhone after it forced me to update to iOS 26. The new animated interface is no good for me. I'll figure out how to turn all of that off, I hope...

I had a lovely drive today. The weather was close to perfect. The sun was out for most of it. But never when it would have been right in my face. The traffic was mostly good. It was only busy in the usual places in and near Nashville. And there was no rain at all. In contrast, tomorrow's travels look to be rainy most of the day.

The entire drive should be during daylight. I hope the rain doesn't slow me down to get home after sunset. I don't imagine I'll be dealing with much traffic, though. It'll be Sunday and the roads I'll be on are rarely busy anytime I travel this route.

I hit the 6,000 mile mark with my car today. In the morning, I'll cross over 6,500. I'll cross 7,000 by the time I get home, I think. Or at least very close to it. These are amazing milestones for me because this is my first brand new car. I've never had these low mileage achievements before... hehehe So I'm really happy about this.

I got great sleep my last 2 nights at Mom and Dad's. So I'm thinking my problem the other night was my missing those supplements. That was the only night I forgot them and the only night of poor sleep. It feels connected. I'll continue to observe how I sleep this coming week. But I've been sleeping well lately.

Breakfast with Malachi and my parents went well for the most part. We went to Cracker Barrel. I'm so grateful Mom was feeling well enough to do that today. She slept really well last night. God gave her everything she needed to have a great morning with her favorite son... HAHAHA j/k

I had pizza at the hotel again. I really enjoy my experience here. The manager always recognizes me and seems happy to see me. He's from Indiana too. Indiana University and Ohio State University are playing a championship football game tonight in Indianapolis. He asked me who was going to win... LOL I said Indiana, of course... LOL He brought out the cook, an Ohio State fan, to have me repeat what I said... LOL It was funny! But I really don't know who will win. And I don't really even care... LOL I grew up an IU fan. I just hope they win because they are an Indiana team. I also find it funny that I was in Indianapolis (adjacent) this morning and the game is there tonight...LOL

I was considering going to Disney on my way home to do some Christmas shopping. But with rain in the forecast, I just want to go home. I even thought about going to the grocery on my way home. But I doubt that will happen either. We need the rain. So I'm grateful. I'll look to see how it goes on my journey tomorrow. I'll adjust my plans as needed. As for Christmas shopping at Disney, I can do some of that in the next two weekends.
