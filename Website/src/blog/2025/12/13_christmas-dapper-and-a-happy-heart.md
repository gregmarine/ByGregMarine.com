# Christmas Dapper and a Happy Heart

### 2025/12/13

I really enjoyed my Christmas dapper outfit today. It isn't quite the level of my original Christmas dapper from last year and the one I did for Dapper Day with Cherie this year. But I still loved it. And it got a lot of attention today. Surprisingly, not a single person said, "I thought Dapper Day was last weekend?" LOL And no one asked why I was dressed up. Only one person asked for help assuming I was Cast... LOL I love dressing dapper. Especially at Christmas time <3

I spent most of the day with Mack. I've missed him and his energy. He missed my energy as well. I'm glad we had this time together. We were able to catch each other up on our lives. We had some deep conversations. And we had some fun. I hope we get together sooner next time. We figured out it had been since February that we last saw each other.

I took Tiny Cherie with me... hehehe Before I met up with Mack, I took her on a little stroll and sent the video to Cherie... hehehe That was fun. I also took a few photos. That tiny e-ink device looks great in the sunlight. I'm so glad I got it. I look forward to using it for other special occasions.

I shared parts of the day with Cherie, Mom, and Tyrese. For Mom and Tyrese, it was only one thing apiece. Mom, it was Cinderella's castle, as usual. Tyrese, it was the drums in the Japan pavilion. I'm glad I sent the one to Tyrese. It came at just the right moment for her. She was working an event and had just seen a 5-year-old cancer patient receive his honorary degree from Duke. And his dad gave a heartfelt speech. It really gives some perspective on life. I sent my video at just the right time and it brightened her day after that experience <3

Both Mom and Tyrese have come often. But Cherie has never been. When she is able to join me in person, I know we'll have the most magical time. Until then, I'll share the most with her. Some of what I share is the same things. But I sometimes find something new... hehehe Today, I did a sort of live text of videos from the safari as I recorded them. And there was that little stroll with Tiny Cherie... hehehe

Something new to me was the Villains show at Hollywood Studios. In a word... AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. I had heard good things about it and seen some of it. But I didn't really quite know what to expect. It blew my mind... LOL I will be doing it again sometime.

We started the day at Hollywood Studios. We did Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railroad, Star Tours and the Villains show. We also watched some live street performers. For Star Tours, I did my *whoaaaa haha* thing. LOL After HS, we went to EPCOT to eat some festival foods. We did almost 2 laps around the World Showcase. Then it was off to Animal Kingdom. We got to see *Kevin* and the holiday puppets they do there. And the safari. And we did the Festival of the Lion King show. After that, we went to Magic Kingdom where we did Little Mermaid and Pirates. So we got all 4 parks in and had our fill in each. It was a really good day <3

When I got back to the hotel, I had dinner at the restaurant they have. It's more upscale than the one in Montgomery. I had 3 tacos: one brisket, one mahi mahi, and one shrimp. They were all really good. But I think the shrimp was the best. I need to try the chicken next!

When I got back to my room, I said, "Biinnngggford! I'm home!" He was NOT happy... LOL Although I love dressing dapper, I also love that feeling when I get home and decompress my body from all the layers... hehehe It feels relaxing, freeing, and has the peaceful easy feeling of being home again. Even when *home* is a hotel, and even a hotel you are sharing with Bingford... LOL

Now I'm writing this journal entry... hehehe My heart is full and happy from this day <3
