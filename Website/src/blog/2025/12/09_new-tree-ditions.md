# New Tree-ditions

### 2025/12/09

Mom has been getting *my* bread for me to have on my visits. But she has been getting the larger loaf instead of the smaller and thinly sliced loaf I typically get. I enjoyed the larger loaf last week so much that I'm going to have it here at home for the time being. With the smaller one, I typically have 4 slices. With the larger one, I just do 2. And I think I like the consistency of this bread better than with the smaller loaf. My morning toast with my coffee makes my heart happy.

I'm back to using Nectar. I had been getting the variety pack. But I decided to order the packs of my favorites. Right now I have mango and fruit punch. Next, I'll likely get peach and cherry pomegranate. I like sticking to the flavors I like most. It makes life better when you aren't *putting up with* those lesser flavors... LOL

I had another one of those days when my heart is full and happy.

Work was okay. I got some encouragement this morning from my boss. And I made some progress on a few things on my plate.

After work, I had dinner and watched the Bible round table for this week's episode. Ooh! I watched the after show for the episode at lunch. After dinner and the round table, I did the next section of the Bible study. I'm connecting with the lesson. But I find it difficult to find certain words. Maybe our discussion will inspire me. That happens sometimes. We ask each other questions sometimes that bring out what we couldn't say when we write our notes. At least, that's something I've experienced... hehehe The after show and round tables help me as well. Sadly, this is our last lesson with *The Chosen* for a while. I wonder what God will lead us to next?

I made some sketches this morning. One was of a cherry blossom idea I'm working on. I shared it with Cherie. I'm glad I did, because she had some encouraging words that inspired a shift in the Christmas card I'm working on. I did a new sketch of the Christmas card on my Palma 2 Pro. That's the device I would use for urban sketching when I'm inspired as I'm out and about. I love how the sketch turned out. I made a few versions of the work using the base sketch. I shared a few with Cherie to get her thoughts. I'll do a little more work on that tomorrow. I ordered the card stock to make the actual Christmas card once I'm finished. This has been so much fun! I think I'd like to make this a tree-dition... LOL These art projects added to my full and happy heart today <3

I also wrote up [part 2 of Our November Vacation](./09_our-november-vacation-part-2). I felt it was a good day to focus on that. It was getting a little long, so I decided I would split up our Disney day into 2 parts like I did for Our August Vacation. As you know, I love to write... hehehe And I love to include all of the details I find important to remember. So those entries can get long. I have yet to go through all of the photos and videos. And I hope to make my social media posts soon.

As of now, I decided not to put my Christmas decorations out this year. The exception is the stocking Trexina (Cherie) made for Trex (me). I have gone back and forth on that this year and realized I'm ready to change it up. It's too late for that this year. And I don't feel my current decorations fit my spirit. I look forward to what I'll be doing in the future.

Part of my concern is the lack of traditions in my adult life. Things have been *broken* in my life for so long. I'm ready to change that. I've already started forming new traditions. So I feel good about what is to come in this area of my life. What I'm feeling in my spirit beckons me to give a warm hug to all who have broken lives as well. I think we can still find the beauty in our broken pieces. And I feel we aren't actually broken at all. We just need to wipe the tears, open our eyes, and look up <3
