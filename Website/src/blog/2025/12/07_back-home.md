# Back Home
### 2025/12/07

I made it home safely. It was almost dinner time when I got back and I don't have any food at the moment. It was raining with storms on their way. So I decided to stop by Olive Garden for dinner. I also got a to-go order to have for lunch tomorrow. The rain is supposed to stop in the morning. So I can do a quick grocery run after work.

Most of my drive was rainy, but since I was driving during the day on a Sunday, it didn't make much of an impact on my journey. Before it began, and well before the heaviest of it, I *went to church*. After I got gas and hit the road, today's live stream was beginning, so I tuned in over my car speakers. After that, I listened to last week's sermon. I followed that up with each of the sermons I missed in October. Those first few hours of driving were Blessed.

I've already unpacked, did all of my laundry, and caught up on all of the TV I missed last week. I was too tired from the drive to do much thinking. So my TV shows made the most sense, and relaxing in general. And laundry isn't taxing. I feel I made the most of my evening.

I did a lot of praying on my two drives this weekend. I didn't listen to any music. It seems I have a lot on my heart. It was good to spend the time in prayer. I made some speech-to-text notes about some things I'd like to explore more after listening to those six sermons and the hours of prayer.

As expected, my body is already healing from the damage caused by the Indiana climate and weather I experienced. That's been encouraging today, I'm sure I'll be right as rain by next weekend. And this tells me my Christmas trip should do okay for my body as well.

I'm ready to go back to work and my routine tomorrow. Since I worked from Indiana last week, it's business as usual for my work. Nothing piled up like it would from a typical vacation. And I've been looking forward to getting back to my routine at home.

I discovered I forgot to bring my new coffee order home from Mom and Dad's. So I had to order my coffee again for here. Hopefully it arrives before I run out of what little I still have left. I'll just give Dad and my brother what I left up there. I can't bring it on the plane and it's too costly to ship. My next driving trip won't be for a while. So it's best to just give it to them up there.

Other than the coffee mishap, I believe everything else is back to normal for me. It's good to be back home <3
