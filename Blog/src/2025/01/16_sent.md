## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Once again, a very timely lesson for such a time as this. The things I have been doing and the things on my heart are coming to align with what I am studying and praying about. This has happened quite often since March 17th last year. That's when I began a fellowship of devotionals and Bible studies. Although I had been doing devotionals prior to that, it wasn't quite like what I've experienced since that day.

Today's prayer focus in on being sent by God into the world. Just yesterday, the events of the day led me to crossing paths with someone I am not praying for. Also, after the fact, I felt sent to California last year. One of those trips connected me with Eaton Canyon; which I'll be talking about later in this entry. And one of theChapel's mission statements is that they *aren't just a place you to to. It's a place you go from*.

The second part of John 11:42 shows Jesus saying, *...so they may believe that You sent Me.* He was praying a prayer specifically so that those present would know and believe that God had sent Him. This was the purpose in Lazarus dying in the first place. This is the purpose in my dying to myself and being risen again as a new creation in Christ. So that I can be sent into the world to proclaim the Gospel of Christ. And to pray.

*Father, once again, I thank You that You hear my prayers. I also thank You that You have sent me into the world to share the Good News of Your love and the salvation You have brought into the world. Thank You for empowering me with Your Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel and to pray for others. Please give me the strength and courage to always be ready to do Your Will as You send me into the world today.*

*You have placed each church in a community to send Your disciples into their community, Lord. Help each church serve that ministry. To be Your hands and feet. To be Your messengers to speak love and hope and faith into a hurting world. The mission of the church isn't to serve themselves but to serve others in Your Name. Please help the church know they are being sent and I thank You for providing all they need to complete that mission.*

*I lift up the pastors to You today. Help them know that as they preach, teach, and ministry their congregations, that they have been sent by You specifically for their church. Empower them with Your Holy Spirit to proclaim the Gospel to the people. To be an encouragement to the people they serve. I pray for their families that they too understand they have been sent to minister to them and lift him up as a representation of Your Love for them.*

*As You send me out, I have one question for You...What are we going to do today?*

*In Your Name, this I pray...so be it!*
