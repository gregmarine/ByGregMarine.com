## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Once again, a very timely lesson for such a time as this. The things I have been doing and the things on my heart are coming to align with what I am studying and praying about. This has happened quite often since March 17th last year. That's when I began a fellowship of devotionals and Bible studies. Although I had been doing devotionals prior to that, it wasn't quite like what I've experienced since that day.

Today's prayer focus in on being sent by God into the world. Just yesterday, the events of the day led me to crossing paths with someone I am not praying for. Also, after the fact, I felt sent to California last year. One of those trips connected me with Eaton Canyon; which I'll be talking about later in this entry. And one of theChapel's mission statements is that they *aren't just a place you to to. It's a place you go from*.

The second part of John 11:42 shows Jesus saying, *...so they may believe that You sent Me.* He was praying a prayer specifically so that those present would know and believe that God had sent Him. This was the purpose in Lazarus dying in the first place. This is the purpose in my dying to myself and being risen again as a new creation in Christ. So that I can be sent into the world to proclaim the Gospel of Christ. And to pray.

*Father, once again, I thank You that You hear my prayers. I also thank You that You have sent me into the world to share the Good News of Your love and the salvation You have brought into the world. Thank You for empowering me with Your Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel and to pray for others. Please give me the strength and courage to always be ready to do Your Will as You send me into the world today.*

*You have placed each church in a community to send Your disciples into their community, Lord. Help each church serve that ministry. To be Your hands and feet. To be Your messengers to speak love and hope and faith into a hurting world. The mission of the church isn't to serve themselves but to serve others in Your Name. Please help the church know they are being sent and I thank You for providing all they need to complete that mission.*

*I lift up the pastors to You today. Help them know that as they preach, teach, and ministry their congregations, that they have been sent by You specifically for their church. Empower them with Your Holy Spirit to proclaim the Gospel to the people. To be an encouragement to the people they serve. I pray for their families that they too understand they have been sent to minister to them and lift him up as a representation of Your Love for them.*

*As You send me out, I have one question for You...What are we going to do today?*

*In Your Name, this I pray...so be it!*

## My Day

### 7:55am

What a morning already! I love my morning prayer walk the most, I think...hehehe I love starting my day with prayer and a devotional. I think after this brief season, I'd like to go back to doing some sort of devotional or Bible study in the morning. I used to do that. But when I changed my sleep schedule, I had less time in the mornings. Right now, I have more time as I've gradually moved to a more *normal* schedule. It has been a blessing. Every morning is a blessing regardless. But mornings like these are ones I feel more connected with God with.

### 9:00am

My 9am meeting is about to start. But I wanted to hop on here real quick...hehehe Today, I switched to 3 slices of toast for breakfast. I like it. The loaf has 21 slices. 3 a day for 7 days is...*drumroll please*...21...LOL It fits well with how my brain works...LOL The first and last days will be a little lighter because of the heel. But that's okay.

### 9:30am

With the assistance of my boss, we discovered the issue with one of our applications that I've been troubleshooting. It's the one I briefly mentioned yesterday as to why I worked a little over yesterday...hehehe I'm glad I walked away from it last night. The issue seems to be a permissions issue with a service account id...LOL It isn't code or configuration. The accounts need the right permissions to work, you know...LOL

I was added to a new daily meeting for user acceptance testing of the systems I'm responsible for. This is part of the big migration I've been working on for 6 months. Things are finally becoming real :-) This is the season I've been working toward and been looking forward to. I like to solve problems. And with things like a migration, there will be problems. I'm glad I am prepared for this. I've learned so much through this process.

### 1:30pm

Today's Bible in a Year reading took quite a while. It took me from Job back to Genesis. It was a new section of Genesis where Abram's (Abraham's) story truly begins. So, there was an extra video to introduce the section. That's on top of the reading itself and the recap that follows...hehehe

I'm thinking about building out this plan on my website and linking to some of the resources I come across along the way. If I do, the pages will be in the *Bible in a Year* format so I can follow along in future years. And anyone else who wants to follow the plan can join in as well. Over the years, I can keep collecting resources that help the study of what is read each day. It could become quite a nice tool to have each day as I continue reading the Bible daily. Plus, as I dive deeper into certain sections in focused Bible study sessions, I can keep building and building. That would be fun!

Work is going really well today. My morning, and the start of the afternoon, has allowed me to keep to my preferred routine today. Unlike the previous 3 days this week...LOL
