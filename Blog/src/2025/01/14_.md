## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Aah! Would you look at that! Two weeks into the new year. And 10 days into this year's season of focused prayer and denying myself something I want in pursuit of something God wants! What a wonderful thing it is to have another day! Thank you, Lord!

Today's prayer focus is to give myself to God. And to pray that others do as well. This isn't just about submitting to His Will. But rather, giving literally everything to Him. Our problems, our struggles, our successes, our failures, our worries, our anxieties, our happiness...and the list goes on and on and on...well, you get the picture.

This isn't always an easy thing. Oftentimes, we wait until we are so desperate that it is the only thing left for us to do. That was even Jesus' last prayer on the cross. Luke 23:46 reads, *Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, "Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit." And when He had said this, He breathed His last.*

The author of the devotional challenges us to commit everything to the Father today...right now...don't wait! What if I were to commit my spirit and everything else to Him first thing. Kind of like how we took communion to start of the new year on January 1st. That was a great way to commit the new year to God!

*Father, into Your hands, I give you my everything today. All of the things that make me happy, joyful, and everything I love. I also give you my worries, anxiety, struggles, and all that is weighing me down. I give to you my job, my family, my friends, and everyone impacted by my existence. Father, all I have is Yours. Thank You for coming along on this journey with me.*

*Also Father, into Your hands, I commit my church. I pray that we give you absolutely everything. I don't mean like giving a portion of our finances or talents or time. I mean fully giving the mission you have for us in the community. I pray we commit to You our worship and our hearts. I pray we commit it all and not just a portion. Take all of us, Lord, I pray!*

*Finally, Father, I pray for the pastors. I pray this also commit all of themselves today to the ministry You have called them to. I pray they commit their families to You as well. May they give themselves wholly and fully over to You to carry them in their struggles and in their celebrations.*

*Thank You so much Lord for leading me to a season in my life where I desire to be fully committed to You. To lay aside all of my own desires to focus on what it is You want. Today, and everyday forward, I commit myself and give myself to You. I want to know You more! In this I pray in Your Name, AMEN!*
