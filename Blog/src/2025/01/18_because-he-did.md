# Because He Did

## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Today marks 2 full weeks in this season. There is only one week left. As I reflect on these past 2 weeks, I'm so glad I'm doing this again. I can't say that enough.

In the devotional, I read the longest prayer Jesus spoke. It is from John 17...the entire chapter. Over the following 6 days, the devotional will take me through each part of the prayer as I conclude this season. For today, the author asks me to *simply contemplate upon this prayer*.

What always stands out in the prayer is how He prayed for all believers, including you and me. John 17:20-21 reads, *I am not asking on behalf of them (His disciples) alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message, that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, an I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.* His prayer for all believers goes on through verse 25. But that part of it just stands out for me.

One of the reasons I was drawn to this devotional was because it is a guide through some of Jesus' prayers. I want to know more about Him through His prayers so that I can pray as He did.

*Jesus, thank You for praying for me the night You were betrayed. I sometimes feel as though I have betrayed You as well. But as a believer, I know You are sanctifying me through the process of living a life committed to You. Please prepare me for the coming days as I'm taken through Your prayer in John 17. Help me receive the message You are preparing me for as I listen to Your Voice.*

*Jesus, thank You for praying for today's church. Thank You that You are showing me that I should pray for today's church too. To have mercy on it and not be resentful. I'm grateful that this message is coming at such a time as You have revealed to me my lack of mercy and forgiveness for today's church. So, today, I commit to praying not just for the church You'll lead me to, but for today's church as a whole. Through the message of the Apostles, may the church be one with You, as You and the Father are One. I cannot be one with You and the church if my heart is against it. Please forgive me and help me pray for the church.*

*Jesus, thank You for praying for the pastors and their families. LORD, I pray that they remain one with You and the church. Please speak through them all so that their message can carry on as the Apostle's did. In hearing their message, may others become one with You as well. Thank You for calling the pastors to the ministry of Your message so that all who hear might be saved. Empower the pastors with Your Holy Spirit.*

*In Jesus Name, AMEN!*

I have a passion for praying for others. I love to do it *because He did*. Even in all of the miracles Jesus performed, He prayed. He came to do the Will of the Father. So, again, I want to do the Will of God *because He did*.

I'm so grateful for this season <3

## My Day

### 8:50am

I got a late start today. That's because I got to bed a little later last night. I think I'm off by an hour. Maybe a little more. I didn't really *sleep in*. I didn't sleep any longer than normal. It's just that I went to bed later.

I'm about to go on my morning walk. I spent a little extra time on my prayer and devotional time this morning. I had a lot to pray about. I also pray as I walk. But I wanted to focus on some specific things today while I was still inside...hehehe

I'm grateful for my new cross. My deer friend gave it to me for Christmas. She has a wooden cross that she cherishes and wanted me to have one too. They are both unique in that they are hand carved. It is just a symbol. But spiritually speaking, it does help me focus. It is also a great reminder to go to prayer often beyond my habitual prayer times. Prayer has become a lifestyle for me. And this cross has been a blessing to support that.

### 1:25pm

I'm having a great day. I increased my walk distance by adding another lap. By the end of the day, I'll have walked 5 miles around the pond...hehehe It is a little warmer today. So no jacket needed. It will get cold again this coming week, though. I don't recall it being cold for so long last year. But, considering how warm and hot it gets most of the year, these cold weeks just seem longer for some reason...LOL

I've begun the final clean up of my desks. I've gone through the remaining stacks and organized it all into manageable piles. Most of it will get boxed up and placed in storage. Sometime later, I'll go through those boxes to decide what stays with me and what goes away. I didn't want to make those decisions this year. Next weekend, I'll decide the new arrangement for all of my desks.

In the recap for today's Bible in a Year plan, Tara-Leigh Cobble mentioned John 17:20...LOL You might recall from above, that's a verse I honed in on this morning...hehehe This is an important passage today!

On both of my walks today, I saw the same duck. I need to look up what kind it is. I've heard it referred to as a turkey-duck...hehehe It's large for a duck species. And some of its face looks turkey like. But the bill makes me think it is a duck. I'll know for sure once I look it up.

Well, it's time for a grocery trip!
