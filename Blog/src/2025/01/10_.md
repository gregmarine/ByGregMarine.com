## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

We've reached the first Friday of this 21 day season. And it's the second Friday of the year. Happy FriYAY!!! I often say the YAY part for other people. For me, I'm still excited everyday now. Each day is a gift from God. Each day has its tasks and special meanings. However, I'm not one to concern myself with what day of the week it actually is. I'm just happy to have another day and that it is one more day closer to God's Kingdom.

Today's prayer focus is about faith. Specifically, asking for God's strength in helping our faith to not fail. We ourselves will fail from time to time. That's different than our faith failing. In Luke 22:31-32, Jesus told Peter that He had prayed that Peter's faith may not fail. This was just before Jesus told Peter that he would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed. But He went further and told Peter that *when* he turned back, to strengthen his brothers (looking ahead, it appears strengthening others is tomorrow's focus). So, although Peter would fail, Jesus knew that his faith would not and that he would return to it.

The prayer for today is one for asking God's strength and Spirit to keep us faithful through our circumstances and failures. There is a lot going on in all our lives. And there is a lot to distract us. One of the fruit of the Spirit is faithfulness. With God's strength and guidance, we too can remain faithful. Praise the Lord that He prayed such a prayer to show us know that we can pray the same over others and ourselves.

*Father in Heaven, thank You that I can come before You today. Thank You for this prayer that You prayed over Peter. Lord, I pray that when I fail, You give me strength so that my faith may not fail too. I am a sinner unworthy of even speaking to You. But Your mercies allow me to come to You today. My faith and trust is in the One You sent, Jesus! In the same Spirit of the prayer You prayed over Peter, I too ask for Your strength. Help me to always turn back to You in faith when I fail and when my circumstances overcome me.*

*As I wait and hope in You for the church You are leading me to, I lift up that church to You. Please be their strength that their faith will not fail. Struggles happen all the time in Your church. Part of my testimony includes such struggles. But with Your strength, the church's faith can be strengthened so that it may not fail. Please guide and direct this church on the path You created for it. Help it remain faithful to You and the community in which it is planted.*

*In the same way, please hold up the pastor and his family. They carry a great burden as leaders of the church. It would be tempting to allow the struggles of everyday life, plus the struggles of the church, to consume him. I pray that his faith may not fail in all of the trials and tribulations he faces. And when he does fail, I pray for Your strength that he will return and strengthen the church.*

*Thank You, again, that I can come before You today and everyday. I love You, Lord! With gratitude, and in Your Name, I pray. AMEN!*



## My Day

I had a corporate meeting today that popped up on my calendar only a few days ago. When I received the invite, I thought to myself that it seemed like short notice for an *All Hands Meeting*...LOL Well, I got my answer to that thought.

I somewhat knew this was coming. I just didn't realize the timing and all. It was nearly a year ago when I received the news my part of the company was being outsourced. And soon after that, we were told that other parts of the company would be sold off...not just outsourced. All of that is happening and seems to be accelerating.

I'm not really sure how this impacts me since I'm just a contractor to that company now. I don't think it does directly. But I'm sure it does in some capacity. It was a good reminder that God is my provider. I said it a year ago, and I'll keep saying it. I'm grateful that all I have is from God. I'll keep doing my job. That's doing my part in my relationship with Him. But it isn't my work or my employer that provides my needs. God just uses these things to do it.

My heart and prayers go out for those who are concerned and worried about how this impacts them. I still remember times when I would get news like I did today and pretty much freak out. Not having answers can make you very anxious. I no longer get anxious about these sorts of things for the most part. I still get anxious about other stuff for sure...LOL But I can empathize with how others feel with this since I've been there before. These transitions in life are never easy.

On a lighter note...hehehe It was bitterly cold again this morning for my walk. So, once again, I bundled up. I took a selfie this time...HAHAHA

You can't really tell, but the hat is the one I have with the wool lining and the flaps that come down over my ears and the back of my neck. The scarf helps keep the air around my mouth warm so I'm not breathing in cold air. My lungs hate that...LOL The air around here has a lot of moisture in it. Cold moisture in my lungs doesn't feel great. I'm wearing two coats, a shirt, and my thermal undershirt. And I have gloves on.

It has been this cold in Florida a few times since I've lived here. Colder in fact. But I never went outside for extended periods of time on those days. Just to my car that has a heater...hehehe I really wanted to walk...LOL It was safe to do so since I have this winter stuff to wear. It felt great and I enjoyed it so much. I never thought I'd ever enjoy the cold again. But I am! It's like when I was a kid...HAHAHA I loved the cold back then. I'm learning to love it all over again <3

My afternoon walk was quite different! Although I did wear a light jacket, it was warm enough that I probably didn't even need it. There is a 30 degree difference between the temperature this morning and that of this afternoon! It's like having winter and spring all in the same day...LOL

Back home in Indiana, they are getting more snow. I think by the time it is over, it will be an additional 4-5 inches on top of what they had the other day. With the forecast showing cold temperatures for the foreseeable future, that snow isn't going anywhere soon. I remember times a while ago when it would snow heavy one day and then melt the next...LOL Weather can be weird...HAHAHA

I've said something like I don't need things to bring meaning to my life. I bring the meaning to the things I do or have in *my* life. It is my version of the *You Only Life Once* philosophy. Well, honestly, it isn't even *me* who brings the meaning to any of it. It really is God who brings the meaning. I'm sure I would enjoy life without God just like anyone. But a life without God feels meaningless to me now.
