# Please Forgive Me

## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

In yesterday's message at theChapel, the pastor mentioned a definition of fasting that resonates with me. He said something to the effect of *fasting is temporary denial of something I want in pursuit of something He wants*. And there is no better way to pursue what He wants than to pray and read the Word daily. Fasting helps me focus my prayers and daily reading when I need to hear something specific. Or this year, a few specific things.

Seasons like the one I'm in at the moment are a blessing because I'm denying some things that I want in the hope that I'll better hear His Voice about what it is He is wanting to tell me. That is why I am doing this. It is helping build my relationship with God. It helps me grow and become a better version of myself. The version God is transforming me into being. It helps me be a better follower of Jesus, to love God more, to love others more, and to find that peace and soul satisfaction God pours out freely.

Today's prayer focus is forgiveness. While hanging on the cross, Jesus said, *Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.* Luke 23:34a The context is that He had just been crucified. In other words, that was the moment His cross was lifted up and the base was secured in the ground. Here He was an innocent man, being given a criminals execution. And yet, He asks God to forgive the very ones who was doing this to Him. And in a way, He wasn't just asking for the forgiveness of those present...but for the whole of humanity.

*Father, please forgive me. Even when I don't know what I'm asking forgiveness for. Please reveal the sin in my life so that I can repent and turn my life away from it. I'm far from perfect. I've lived a less than perfect life. There is no sin that You do not know about. I do not know what I am doing.*

*Please forgive others who have harmed or wronged me. Even if they do not know they have done so. Although, I believe I'm more often than not hurt by my own expectations. There isn't anyone perfect. Please forgive them and help me to forgive them myself. Just like me, they do not know what they are doing.*

*Lord, the church is also far from perfect. Please forgive the church for the sins they are committing against you, each other, and to the world. It's an imperfect place, made up of imperfect people, and being run by imperfect policy. Please for give her for she does not know what she is doing.*

*And please forgive the pastors. They are all human just like me. And they have the added burden of responsibility for everything they speak at the pulpit! I cannot imagine the weight of that! So please forgive them of their sins against You and others. They do not know what they are doing.*

*Thank You that I can ask for forgiveness for myself and others. It is a gift I cherish very much. Help me live a life that reflects my gratitude for You gift of salvation. Please empower me with Your Holy Spirit to do the good work You have planned for me today as I seek first Your Kingdom and Your righteousness. In Your Name, AMEN!*
