## 21 Days of Prayer and Fasting

Today, I take another break from a specific prayer focus to reflect at the previous 4 days. The next section of this devotional is on *the longest prayer*. After that week is over, it concludes with another break to finish out the 21 days. And then there are a few days of recaps that will take me just past my 21 days.

On my last break this past Sunday, I had mentioned I hadn't yet gone back to last year's journal entries. But then last night, I mentioned I finally started to do that. I love to see the progress I'm making on this journey called life. Journaling has been a blessing that I'm so glad I started last year. Well, technically, I started it the year before in a private journal. But it wasn't well organized like this one is...hehehe

So, what I have learned in the last 4 days? Once again, the author mentions the importance of not moving on from one prayer to the next until I'm ready. In my last break, I wasn't sure how that really worked. But this time, it is becoming more clear to me. Again, it's still based on the authors plan and the path he is taking with these prayers. I think I'm starting to understand a little more about what he means, though.

Here is a recap of the last 4 prayer focuses:

1. [Forgiveness of others](./13_please-forgive-me#_21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting)
2. [Giving ourselves to God](./14_gregilocks-and-the-3-in-1#_21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting)
3. [Thanking God for hearing us](./15_half-way-there#_21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting)
4. [Help us to know we are sent and that others will know we are sent](./16_sent#_21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting)

The fasting is helping me focus on asking, seeking, and knocking. I'm asking for God to guide me in some areas of my life this year that I feel are important to my relationship to Him and others. In my pursuit to love God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love others as myself, I need all the help I can get...hehehe I'm seeking His Will in these matters so that I'll know which doors I need to be knocking on.

This devotional is a way for me to change the way I pray. I wanted a better understanding of what prayer is and how I should be prayer. I felt led to this devotional in my pursuit to better understand these things. It has been taking me through the actual prayers of Jesus from the Word. It goes beyond the infamous *Lord's Prayer*. I feel I needed this and I'm grateful to be on this journey.

## My Day

### 9:30am

It's been a busy morning...hehehe But I wanted jump in a make a quick timestamp. I enjoyed my morning walk once again. I'm so glad to be back to doing those this year. I'm now up to 4+ miles per day overall. And most of the time spent walking includes prayer. And with the prayers, sometimes it's me talking and sometimes I'm just listening.

I have more thoughts on the Eaton fire. I made a placeholder for it above. I'm not yet sure if I'll write anything or just remove it. If I do write, you'll likely have read it already...hehehe But as of writing this timestamp entry, I don't yet know if I'll do it or not. If you didn't see it above, I removed it...LOL I mostly have thoughts based on this week's Bible study on mercy.

Unsurprisingly, these 2 weeks of prayer and fasting so far are making an impact on how I feel, think, and pray. No matter where I am in life in the future, I hope I keep doing these seasons <3
